## Participedia Front-end code

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/participedia/frontend.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a static content front-end site which powers the upcoming version 3
of Participedia.net.

It currently uses `hjs-webpack` for the basic build/update configuration (although see #16)

## Development Approach

React, redux where appropriate; react-router for all routes; `react-intl` localization (all copy should be localized).
`Auth0` for authentication.  Material-ui as baseline UI framework.

### Requirements

* `node` and `npm` v6 or later (node is just used in the build process)

### Setup

Clone the repo:

```
npm clone git@github.com:participedia/frontend.git
```

npm install:

```
npm install
```

Install SASS (see https://sass-lang.com for instructions)

### Configuration

Copy `sample.env` to `.env`, and adjust it to fit.  In general, the only choice will be whether
to use your own API server (in case you're changing the server at the same time) or the staging site.

The `sample.env` file has both settings, you just uncomment whichever one you want to use in your setup.

### Development

`npm start` will start a dev server which will detect code changes (both
in JS and CSS) and do "hot reloading".  It will not detect changes to the 
webpack config for example.

### Deployment

`npm build:js`

### Contributing

We use Javascript `Standard` as the linting style.
