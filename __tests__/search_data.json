A tal proposito gli impegni da prendere devono conformarsi alle caratteristiche dei territori a cui si riferiscono e rispondere alle necessità delle popolazioni che si impegnano ad adottarli: le tematiche di discussione e intervento possono essere tra le più svariate, lotta alla povertà, cambiamento dei modelli di produzione e consumo, dinamiche demografiche, conservazione e gestione delle risorse naturali, protezione dell'atmosfera, degli oceani e della biodiversità, prevenzione della deforestazione, promozione di un' agricoltura sostenibile, fonti di energia rinnovabili, raccolta differenziata, ecc.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Agenda 21 - “l’elenco delle azioni da compiere nel corso del XXI secolo perché lo sviluppo sostenibile sia raggiunto” - è un progetto dell’ONU nato in occasione della Conferenza Mondiale su “Ambiente e Sviluppo Sostenibile” tenutasi a Rio de Janeiro nel 1992, il cui obiettivo è creare un modello concreto di sviluppo che risponda alle necessità del presente senza compromettere la capacità delle generazioni future di soddisfare le proprie esigenze. In seguito a tale Conferenza 178 governi di tutto il mondo, tra cui l'Italia, hanno sottoscritto e adottato questo documento di intenti destinato alla promozione del così detto <em>sviluppo sostenibile,</em> che tenendo conto di variabili sociali, ambientali ed economiche si propone di individuare in un determinato contesto territoriale eventuali elementi di incompatibilità o conflitto esistenti tra attività socio-economiche e politiche di protezione e salvaguardia dell'ambiente.</p><p>Nel capitolo 28 dell’Agenda 21 l’ONU riconosce agli <em>Enti Locali</em> il ruolo di <em>promotori</em> nei processi che coinvolgano tutte le realtà rappresentative della società civile, rafforzandone il ruolo e la partecipazione, e che portino alla stesura di <em>Piani d’Azione </em>per lo sviluppo sostenibile a livello locale. Le autorità locali - Comuni, Provincie, Comunità Montane, Regioni, ecc. - sono invitate a giocare un ruolo chiave nell'educare, mobilitare e rispondere al pubblico per la promozione di uno sviluppo sostenibile, attraverso la consultazione e la costruzione di consenso, in una sorta di scambio reciproco in cui è a loro volta possibile assorbire dalle comunità locali e dalle imprese le informazioni necessarie per la formulazione e l’applicazione di nuove strategie.</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>In Emilia Romagna, nel caso specifico della provincia di Forlì e Cesena, l’adozione dell’Agenda 21 Locale ha interessato oltre ai due capoluoghi, il comune di Bagno di Romagna in collaborazione con i comuni di Sarsina e di Verghereto, i comuni della costa adriatica romagnola - Cesenatico, Gatteo, San Mauro Pascoli e Savignano Sul Rubicone - i comuni della Comunità Montana dell’Appennino Forlivese in collaborazione con la Comunità Montana dell'Acquacheta. Ciò che risulta evidente ad un primo sguardo è l’<em>eterogeneità</em> degli attori partecipanti e la <em>varietà </em>delle <em>tipologie </em>di <em>stakeholders</em> prendenti parte al processo partecipativo: singoli cittadini, Forze dell’Ordine, Associazioni di Categoria, Sindacati Agricoli e non, Associazioni di Consumatori e Ambientaliste, Ordini Professionali, Università, Scuole, Enti di Formazione, Istituzioni Religiose, Associazioni sportive, Banche, Fondazioni, Imprese, Istituzioni, Associazioni Studentesche, Consiglieri Provinciali, Partiti e Parlamentari.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Tale processo partecipativo si è strutturato principalmente in due fasi, una <em>interna</em> ed una <em>esterna</em>. La prima è riassumibile nell’incontro avvenuto presso la Giunta Provinciale, alla presenza del Presidente e di tutti gli assessori, mirato all’elaborazione della <strong>Dichiarazione di Sostenibilità della Giunta</strong>, nella quale si riconosce lo sviluppo sostenibile come linea strategica delle politiche a livello provinciale: in tale documento, nel perseguire politiche per lo sviluppo ecosostenibile del territorio, l’ente si impegna a <em>operare nella tutela dell’ambiente naturale assicurando una gestione delle risorse efficace ed efficiente</em>, <em>indirizzare lo sviluppo economico endogeno verso forme imprenditoriali che privilegino ricerca ed innovazione</em>, <em>assicurando una crescita omogeneamente diffusa, valorizzando la qualità del lavoro, mantenendo e possibilmente aumentando la coesione sociale, territoriale e multietnica, cercando di assicurare l’equilibrio delle opportunità sociali per le fasce deboli con una garanzia di welfare</em>. In quest’ottica il <em>tentativo</em> di promozione di un maggior livello di democrazia e partecipazione dei cittadini nei processi decisionali rappresenta il metodo di attivazione dei processi di sostenibilità.</p><p>La fase<em> esterna</em> ha invece previsto in un primo momento il coinvolgimento degli <em>stakeholders: </em>le procedure di individuazione e coinvolgimento dei portatori d’interesse sono state guidate da uno dei principi della <em>governance </em>definiti nel Libro Bianco della Commissione Europea, il “principio di apertura”, che prevede il coinvolgimento di tutti i portatori d’interesse di una comunità nei processi partecipativi, ovvero in questo caso, l’individuazione di tutti i soggetti che a livello provinciale sono portatori di un <em>interesse condiviso</em>. Mediante tale processo di coinvolgimento, sviluppato per area <em>territoriale,</em> ci si propone di incentivare la partecipazione di tutti i diversi interessi presenti nel territorio provinciale. La selezione degli invitati agli incontri tematici è stata fatta anche coerentemente con il tema di discussione dei singoli workshop in questione, tuttavia essendo Agenda 21 Locale un processo per definizione <em>volontario</em>, sono stati accolti all’interno del Forum anche tutti quei cittadini che spontaneamente ne hanno chiesto di far parte. In occasione di ogni incontro sono state inviate lettere invito personalizzate con il programma dei lavori, alla cui spedizione seguiva poi un <em>re-call</em> telefonico per la conferma della presenza.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>Per la fase operativa del processo è stata utilizzata la metodologia EASW® - <em>European Awareness Scenario Workshop</em> – della Commissione Europea, basata su due attività principali: in un primo momento la “<strong>definizione di scenari</strong>” e in seguito la “<strong>proposta di idee</strong>”. In generale, l’EASW serve a stimolare la partecipazione democratica nelle scelte legate al miglioramento delle condizioni di vita nelle comunità. Consente ai partecipanti di scambiarsi informazioni, discutere i temi ed i processi che governano lo sviluppo tecnologico e l'impatto delle tecnologie sull'ambiente naturale e sociale, stimolandone la capacità di identificare e pianificare soluzioni concrete ai problemi esistenti.</p><p>Nella prima fase di lavoro i partecipanti, suddivisi in gruppi di origine omogenei, hanno costruito una propria autonoma visione del futuro. Al tal fine è stato necessario stimolare un approccio integrato che tenesse conto della complessità e delle interdipendenze che caratterizzano i contributi forniti. Indipendentemente dal tema in discussione, ai partecipanti si è richiesto di definire il più possibile le caratteristiche future dello scenario che si apprestavano a immaginare, in riferimento al quale sono stati chiamati a suggerire possibili ed efficaci modi concreti di realizzazione. Ciascuno scenario ha messo in evidenza ciò che il gruppo si auspicava che accadesse relativamente alla sostenibilità del proprio territorio in un margine di previsione di 10 anni, specificando i fattori chiave di successo.</p><p>Nella seconda fase i partecipanti, suddivisi in gruppi misti, hanno formulato proposte operative sulle azioni necessarie da intraprendere per realizzare lo scenario futuro costruito. In questa attività ai partecipanti è stato chiesto di essere concisi e concreti, di spiegare i passaggi da realizzare e di individuare i soggetti dell’azione (CHI) e le modalità di realizzazione (COME). In ogni incontro tematico i partecipanti sono stati invitati ad individuare obiettivi strategici, specifici, azioni, attori e priorità.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Il <strong>14 maggio 2003</strong> è avvenuta la <strong>Costituzione</strong> e l’<strong>Attivazione del Forum Provinciale</strong> <strong>Permanente</strong> di Agenda 21 Locale e la scelta delle aree tematiche di approfondimento dei <em>workshop tematici</em>: all’incontro erano presenti più di un centinaio di portatori d’interesse del mondo istituzionale, economico, produttivo, agricolo, dell’associazionismo culturale, ambientalista e del mondo del volontariato. Grazie alla collaborazione con un <em>team</em> di ricerca dell’Università di Siena è stata presentata un’analisi dell’Impronta Ecologica della Provincia, ovvero l’analisi dei consumi e degli impatti ambientali di un territorio in rapporto alla disponibilità di quest’ultimo e un’analisi <em>emergetica</em>, che considera i processi necessari alla produzione di energia e i materiali utilizzati in un tale processo, includendo sia fattori economici - l’energia e la materia utilizzate quantificabili anche in termini monetari - sia fattori ambientali, legati al consumo di risorse espresso in unità di energia solare: entrambe le metodologie hanno evidenziato il forte impatto delle attività antropiche sul territorio provinciale.</p><p>Il Forum si è composto di tre workshop, svoltisi in diversi luoghi della provincia e in giornate diverse, nei quali la presenza dei partecipanti è stata affiancata da tutor tecnici con l’obiettivo di arricchire e approfondire da un punto di vista più strettamente tecnico il lavoro. Le tematiche di riferimento sono emerse dalla riflessione circa gli ambiti “sensibili” suscettibili di approfondimento partecipato, considerando le analisi e gli approfondimenti sull’impronta ecologica del territorio.</p><p>Il primo workshop -19 settembre 2003-  ha avuto come argomento “I consumi e gli stili di vita”, dal quale sono emersi sottogruppi di discussione sui temi di <em>energia</em>, <em>rifiuti</em>, <em>trasporti e logistica </em>e<em>  strumenti di sostenibilità. </em></p><p>“L’agricoltura e il territorio” è stato l’argomento del secondo incontro, svoltosi il 17 ottobre 2003, che ha visto la formazione di sottotematiche riguardanti la <em>gestione delle risorse idriche</em>, <em>l’uso del territorio</em>, <em>le produzioni ecocompatibili, l’agricoltura del futuro</em>.</p><p>“L’innovazione e lo sviluppo” è stato il titolo dell’ultima parte, svoltasi il 7 novembre 2003, che ha visto discussioni attorno alle tematiche di: <em>informazione, formazione e partecipazione</em> come presupposti per la diffusione di informazione, condivisione, conoscenza e approfondimento delle problematiche ambientali; <em>ricerca e innovazione</em> come punto di partenza per la nascita di nuovi filoni d’indagine e per la conoscenza del territorio nelle sue forme più peculiari; <em>nuove personalità e formazione, </em>riguardo i contributi e gli incentivi per il supporto alla creazione di profili professionali qualificati ricercati sul mercato del lavoro; <em>identità e territorio,</em> riguardante la nascita di un nuovo senso di percezione del territorio che valorizza le specificità e i tratti caratteristici.</p><p>L’<strong>11 febbraio 2004</strong> è stato infine presentato il <strong>Piano d’Azione Locale d’Area</strong>: la fase di elaborazione del documento ha comportato la raccolta del lavoro svolto da ciascun forum tematico. Tale fase rappresenta il momento di individuazione dei nuovi obiettivi, stimoli, idee, ragionamenti intorno al tema della “sostenibilità”, in modo integrato con le attività che già l’ente svolge, con l’obiettivo di costruire un quadro il più completo possibile di ciò che viene fatto sul territorio e di quello che i portatori d’interesse rilevano come <em>prioritario</em> da realizzare.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Nel caso dell’Agenda 21 Locale della provincia di Forlì e Cesena il livello di partecipazione degli stakeholder all’avvio del Forum è stato alto, ma ciò che può destare dubbi sull’efficacia del funzionamento del processo, sull’equilibrio del processo decisionale stesso, sulla sua apertura, sull’estraneità a conflitti di interesse e a pressioni di tipo politico-economico sono i dati riguardanti l'<em>eterogeneità</em> della composizione del corpo partecipante, nonché la provenienza dei rispettivi attori: di questi infatti ben il 46% era costituito da rappresentanti di Istituzioni, il 17% da Imprese, l’11% da Associazioni di Categoria, il 10% da associazioni Ambientaliste, il 6%da Enti di Formazione, il 4% da sindacati agricoli, solamente il 3% da cittadini, e un 1% spettava rispettivamente a Ordini Professionali, Scuole e Gruppi di Partito e Parlamentari.</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.a21italy.it\">http://www.a21italy.it</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.agenda21.it/\">http://www.agenda21.it/</a></p><p><a href=\"http://cordis.europa.eu/easw/\">http://cordis.europa.eu/easw/</a></p><p><a href=\"http://osservatoriopartecipazionerer.ervet.it/\">http://osservatoriopartecipazionerer.ervet.it/</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.provincia.fc.it/agenda21/\">http://www.provincia.fc.it/agenda21/</a></p><p><a href=\"http://partecipazione.regione.emilia-romagna.it/entra-in-regione/progetti/agende-21\">http://partecipazione.regione.emilia-romagna.it/entra-in-regione/progett...</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/\">http://www.un.org/esa/dsd/agenda21/</a></p><p> </p>","average_annual_budget":null,"targeted_audience_JSON":"[\"General Public\", \"Organized Groups (e.g. NGOs, Business Associations)\"]","title_en":"Agenda 21 Locale (Province of Forli-Cesena, Italy)","purpose":"Consultation (i.e. to advise decision makers)||Raise public awareness","facetoface_online_or_both_JSON":"[\"Face-to-Face\"]","geo_latitude":"44° 13' 12.666\" N","facilitator_type":"Professional Facilitators","specific_topics":"Sustainable Development","lead_image":"{\"src\": \"agenda21%20.jpg\", \"title\": \"\"}","typical_sponsoring_entity_JSON":"[\"International Organization\", \"Regional Government (e.g. State, Provincial, Territorial)\", \"Local Government (e.g. Village, Town, City)\", \"Academic Institution\"]","type":"case"},{"facilitated":"Yes","file_attachments":null,"decision_methods_JSON":"[\"Getting sense of room/group (i.e. no formal voting)\", \"Opinion Survey\", \"Voting\"]","purpose_other":null,"geo_country":"United States","other_method_of_communication_with_audience":null,"geo_postal_code":"","geo_longitude":"0° 0' 0\" E","facilitator_type_other":null,"number_of_volunteers":null,"method_of_communication_with_audience_JSON":"[\"Public Report\", \"Policy Recommendations\", \"Public Hearings/Meetings\"]","updated_date":"2016-05-28T15:34:49","demographics_other":null,"methods":"560","geo_street":"","post_date":"2012-01-09T16:36:22","type_of_funding_entity_JSON":"[\"Philanthropic Organization (i.e. dedicated to making monetary grants or gifts)\"]","video":null,"who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative_JSON":"[\"199\"]","number_of_part-time_staff":null,"method_of_recruitment_other":null,"staff_type":null,"ongoing":"No","issue":"Budgeting||Economic Development","who_paid_for_the_project_or_initiative_JSON":"[\"Peter G.

The 19 communities were as follows:  Albuquerque, New Mexico; Augusta, Maine; Casper, Wyoming; Chicago, Illinois; Columbia, South Carolina; Dallas, Texas; Des Moines, Iowa; Detroit, Michigan; East Palo Alto, California; Grand Forks, North Dakota; Jackson, Mississippi; Louisville, Kentucky; and Missoula, Montana.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The goal of the meeting was simple and straightforward: participants were asked to answer the question “How should America grapple with its growing national debt?”  Over the course of the day Americans from all walks of life came together to discuss their values and come up with solutions to this problem.</p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>The project was funded by grants from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.  The event was facilitated by AmericaSpeaks.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>AmericaSpeaks utilized several processes to ensure a diverse and representative set of participants.  The organization set up a webpage where citizens who were interested in being involved in the discussion could register to participate.  AmericaSpeaks also enlisted the help of local groups and grassroots organizations to ensure diverse participation in the specific locations of the deliberation and reach out to unaffiliated participants.  In order to gather relevant information, the registration form for the event asked for the age, income, race, and party affiliation of each applicant.</p><p>The make-up of event participants is detailed under the \"Notes\" section below. In most cases, participants represented an accurate portrayal of United States demographics with a few exceptions.  Hispanics were underrepresented.  The average age of participants was skewed to be much older than the national average and there was a stronger liberal presence than a conservative one.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>On the day of the event, participants were seated randomly at small discussion tables with 8-10 participants and one facilitator per table.  The facilitator was an experienced volunteer pre-screened by AmericaSpeaks.  The event lasted for almost seven hours.  The participants began by talking about values, economic recovery, and challenges to cutting the deficit. </p><p>They then spent almost three hours learning about, discussing, and then voting on the 42 spending and revenue options provided them.  These 42 policy options were given to the participants before the event along with background reading material.  The options were drafted by 30 prominent fiscal experts that spanned the ideological range from liberal to conservative.  The goal of the 42 options was to reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion by 2025. </p><p>While the groups were discussing, experts were available to answer questions and brief presentations by experts and Congressmen were given throughout the day.  While these discussions occurred, table groups could submit ideas via laptops on each table.  These ideas were then read and analyzed by a team of professional, deemed the “theme team”, who looked for nation-wide themes.  The theme team identified certain nation-wide themes and individuals used keypads to express their personal preference.  Video links allowed participants at different sites to share ideas periodically. </p><p>At the end of the day, participants developed messages to send to leaders in Washington, D.C.  Two popular messages included “abandon the failed politics of partisanship” and “please find the political will to use this input as if it were coming from a powerful lobbying group – because we are”.  Participants were asked to reflect on the tone and quality of the political discussion in our country today, as well as the tone and quality of the discussions at the Our Budget, Our Economy Town Meeting:</p><p><em>How satisfied are you with the tone and quality of our discussions here today?</em></p><p>Very Satisfied: 62%</p><p>Satisfied: 29%</p><p>Neutral: 6%</p><p>Dissatisfied: 2%</p><p>Very Dissatisfied: 1%</p><p> </p><p><em>How satisfied are you with the tone and quality of political discussion in our country today?</em></p><p>Very Satisfied: 1%</p><p>Satisfied: 3%</p><p>Neutral: 8%</p><p>Dissatsified: 31%</p><p>Very Disatisfied: 58%</p><p> </p><p>Participants had this to say about their experiences:</p><p>“The most important thing I learned from this process is that ordinary citizens could tackle a complex issue, filter it civilly through their own perspective, and come up with consensus.  I literally did not think this was possible”. –Fran G., Portland, OR</p><p>“It was so refreshing to have civil discourse among people of different ages, persuasions, and backgrounds.  Congress could learn a lot from our experience.  The tone of our discussions was polite, respectful, and everyone contributed.” – MaryEllen S., Albuquerque, NM</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><ul><li>2/3 of table groups’ final packages reduced the debt by more than $1 trillion.</li><li>Participants moderated their views and compromised: Conservatives became more supportive of raising taxes on wealthy.  Liberals became more supportive of a 5% cut to discretionary programs.</li></ul><p>Input from the event was presented to President Obama’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform</p><p>The individual survey responses from the day were highly structured by ideology, but the packages put together by the tables had a definite lack of ideological structure, suggesting compromise and creativity.  When asked to discuss policies with their fellow citizens, participants tended to set aside their ideological commitments in order to work toward the common goal of fiscal responsibility and achieve the set task of reducing the national debt.  </p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>This deliberative event shows that considered opinions are important.  When national surveys poll citizen values, they do not take into account considered opinions that are important in the process of reaching a goal.  Though citizens have priorities, they are often willing to compromise some of their priorities in favor of reaching a beneficial solution.</p><p>The MacArthur Foundation preliminary analysis found that this was the</p><p>“largest national experiment in structured public deliberation to date in the United States and so constitutes an unprecedented opportunity to explore both public views about the substantive topic of public spending and more general questions about the dynamics of public deliberation”.</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a

with Belgium's recent \"democratic crisis\" by bringing citizens together. <a href=\"http://www.g1000.org/\">G1000</a> aims to revitalize and \"advise\" Belgium's current representative democratic system by complementing it with deliberative democracy.  It is a response to the increasing ineffectiveness of the representative democracy system, as evidenced in part by the 2010-11 parliamentary crisis.</p><p>The G1000 was conceived as a project that would complement representative politics, rather than replace it through an institutional redesign. The purpose of the project is to engage a wider audience in political discourse and generate popular and useful policy suggestions. The large size of the deliberative project was aimed towards raising more of an awareness around the issue in Belgian politics and policy making. The G1000 took place in three distinct phases; each used a different method of deliberative democracy, but worked towards results that informed and served as a starting point for the next. </p><p>The projects' organizers published a manifesto in the following format analyzing the ongoing problems and analyzing potential solutions and alternatives:</p><p><em>Analysis </em><br />1) The political crisis in Belgium is not only a Belgian crisis, but also a crisis of democracy in general. Similar problems have occurred in the Netherlands and Great Britain as well. In a democracy, citizen govern themselves, either directly or indirectly. Belgium has been a representative democracy since its founding in 1830.<br />2) However, the formula is reaching its limits after two centuries. Elections obstruct more than facilitate good governance. There is little party loyalty left, so political parties need to fight for every vote in an increasingly media driven political landscape. Electoral promises have been becoming ever more unrealistic.<br />3) After the demise of pillarisation, civil society organizations have partly lost their function as intermediaries between political organizations and the wider public.<br />4) The emergence of a much more interactive Internet and Web 2.0 have become important factors to consider. Citizens have never been as quickly informed and armed with the ability to follow and comment on the latest news moment by moment. In contrast, however, citizens can only vote every four years. Never before has the citizen been so opinionated and yet so powerless.<br />5) Politicians in 2011 are like a team of heart surgeons who have to perform a delicate operation in the middle of a full football stadium. Supporters shout at every movement of the cardiologists, but no-one dares to move, ultimately to the detriment of the patient.<br />6) Democracy has become a dictatorship of elections.</p><p><em>Alternative</em><br />1) Everywhere innovation seems to be encouraged and expected, except in a democracy. In fact, we’re still following the procedures of 1830 in 2011.<br />2) Many Western countries have experimented with deliberative or participatory democracy over the past few years. These tries have often proven successful, even on highly important issues (the new constitution in Iceland) or in more problematic contexts (Northern Ireland).<br />3) The Belgian government as of yet does not have a tradition of deliberative democracy. Over the last half-century, politicians have been too busy with constitutional reforms to give priority to democratic reforms. But deliberative democracy is interesting to transcend the limitations of representative democracy. It does not replace the work of parliaments and parties, but wants to complement it. This could be the future of democracy.</p><h3><strong>History</strong></h3><p>The impetus for the project came from the Belgian political crisis, which began in 2007. It reached a protracted climax after the June 2010 federal elections, when parliamentary elections did not result in any clear majority. Neither of the two largest parties that were elected, the Flemish conservative and regionalist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) and the Francophone social-democratic Socialist Party (PS), were able to create an easy coalition. In the end, it took 541 days for the new parliament to agree on a government.</p><p>On June 10, 2011, a manifesto was published in five national newspapers, containing among other things the problem analysis summarized above. The first 27 signatories were the initiators of the G1000. Within a few weeks following its publication more than 10,000 people signed the Manifesto. The G1000 project is designed in three phases:</p><p>July- November 2011: <em>public agenda setting</em> through a large scale online consultation</p><p>November 11, 2011: 704 citizens were gathered (of 1,000 people who had accepted an invitation) to discuss with each other at a ‘<em>Citizens’ Summit</em>’ in a large hall in Brussels. The event was live-streamed on the website of the organization, and two side projects enabled the organization of a simultaneous online discussion (G-Home) as well as the gathering of citizens in smaller groups all across the country (G-Off).</p><p>September- November 2012: In three weekends, a <em>citizens’ panel</em> of 32 people elaborated on the ideas and proposals of the previous phase.</p><p>A closing ceremony was held on the 11th of November 2012, during which the 32 participants of the Citizens’ Panel presented their final report.</p><h3><strong>Funding and Organisation</strong></h3><p>G1000 was initiated by 27 people, including native speakers of all three official languages of Belgium (i.e. Dutch, French, and German). Their background lies in a variety of occupations: in academia (political scientist, professor of law, professor of sociology); communications and technology (radio journalist, digital media and marketing consultant, web developer); arts (novelist, actresses, playwright, cultural organization executives, graphic designer); and the non-profit sphere (activist, non-profit executives).</p><p>The website of G1000 claims that it is “run entirely by volunteers (the only paid collaborators are the external consultants that have helped us to implement the process).” G1000 also partners with <a href=\"http://www.foundationfuturegenerations.org/index.php?golang=EN&amp;__utma=1.441173061.1349999708.1349999708.1349999708.1&amp;__utmb=1.2.10.1349999708&amp;__utmc=1&amp;__utmx=-&amp;__utmz=1.1349999708.1.1.utmcsr=(direct)%7Cutmccn=(direct)%7Cutmcmd=(none)&amp;__utmv=-&amp;__utmk=24786\">The Foundation for Future Generations</a>, “the only Belgian foundation exclusively devoted to sustainable development”.</p><p>G1000 organizers chose to accept only donations rather than sponsors, public, or research money. By financing the project through crowd funding and keeping donator information private, the project avoided creating “privileged sponsors.” Over 3000 donors have supported the project thus far.</p><h3><strong>Participant Selection</strong></h3><p>During the <em>first phase</em> of Public Agenda Setting, any person with Internet access could participate by proposing a question or theme for the Citizens’ Summit. More than 6000 individuals took part in this process.</p><p>For the <em>second phase</em>, the Citizens’ Summit, 90% of the participants were selected randomly through Random Digit Dialing, a phone outreach technique that yielded a 3% “yes” (acceptance of the invitation to participate) response rate. The other 10% of participants were from marginalized demographics such as homeless people or immigrants; G1000 organizers encouraged these individuals to participate by working with grassroots organizations.</p><p>Participants ranged from 18 to 85 years old, and their gender and linguistic diversity reflected that of Belgian inhabitants (participants were 52-48 female-male, and 61-39 Dutch-French speaking compared to the Belgian’s overall 58-32 Dutch-French ratio). 1000 participants committed to attending the Summit, while 704 actually attended.</p><p>In addition, 1,086 people participated through two side projects, G-Home and G-Off: 730 people joined the online G-Home discussion module, and 356 people came to the G-Offs, the simultaneously organized local mini-summits spread throughout the country. These participants were self-selected.</p><p>Of course there was a degree of self-selection in the G1000 Citizens’ Summit as well: as mentioned, measurers were taken to keep the group roughly representative of the country as a whole on a number of characteristics, they were still of a small minority of people willing to invest time in the project. Their reasons for participating were as follows: 63% wanted to show their personal commitment as a citizen; 52% was worried about the democratic and political crisis; 43% participated to renew democracy; 35% participated because of curiosity and in order not to miss the experience; 29% was interesting in the process of dialogue in diversity; and 21% wanted to contribute to restoring the dialogue between the communities in Belgium (most likely referring to the Flemish and Walloon communities).  </p><p>The 32 participants in the Citizens’ Panel, the <em>third phase</em>, were selected from participants in the G1000, G-Offs, and G-Home and who had indicated that they wished to be considered for the Panel (491 in total). They were selected through a random selection process with controls for gender, language, region, and age as well as an ex-post control for socio-economic background. The distribution of participants was as follows:</p><p><strong>Native language    Gender           Education            Age</strong><br />Dutch: 18                 Female: 16       Secondary: 12      - 30 : 7<br />French: 12               Male: 16           Vocational: 8         30-45: 9<br />German: 2                                        University: 12        45-60: 9<br />                                                                                      60+ : 7</p><h3><strong>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</strong></h3><p>In the G1000’s <em>first phase</em>, “Public Agenda Setting”, participants determined the agenda for the later Citizens’ Summit. Throughout July 2011, Belgians were encouraged to submit questions, suggestions or problems through the G1000 website. Anyone who had made a proposal could also vote for the ideas of others.</p><p>The results were a few thousand useful ideas, which were grouped by the organizers into 25 themes representing the most common topics. These were posted online in October 2011 and put up for a vote. The public was asked to select a top three of important topics, which resulted in three themes for the Citizens’ Summit in phase two: “Social Security”, “Distribution of Wealth in Times of Financial Crisis”, and “Immigration”. The ideas appeared in a random order for each participant, and organizers ran an IP Check to ensure that no individual or group had skewed the results through mass voting.</p><p><em>The second phase</em>, was a Citizens’ Summit, held on November 2011 in Brussels. 704 people (of the 1,000 selected) attended the event, which was held according to the Town Hall Meeting format. The participants were divided among 81 tables (meaning approximately 9 people per table), and invited to share and discuss their visions on the three selected themes.</p><p>Each topic was introduced with presentations by two experts. Presenters were Bea Cantillon (University of Antwerp) and Philippe Van Parijs (Université catholique de Louvain) for Social Security; Koen Schoors (University of Ghent) and Eric De Keuleneer (Université Libre de Bruxelles) on Distribution of Wealth in Times of Financial Crisis; and Marie-Claire Foblets (KU Leuven) and Marco Martiniello (University of Liège) for Immigration. After every set of presentations, the theme was discussed at the tables. The results of these discussions were subsequently submitted as proposals to the control desk, where they were aggregated and projected on screens throughout the room. Every participant could then indicate their preferences one last time in a voting round on the proposals of the topic just discussed. Participants were asked to indicate two preferences on each topic (with social security divided into four topics: unemployment; pensions; and child support; health care) for a total of six topics.</p><p>There were 35 Dutch, 29 French, 35 bilingual and one German table, with a facilitator present at each table, plus an interpreter for the bilingual tables. The discussions were structured by the facilitators to ensure that each group achieved the goals, of clearly defining the problem, suggesting solutions, and “taking stock” of the various perspectives and ideas of participants. Facilitators further ensured that the discussions were inclusive and open for all participants. To help participants uncomfortable with public speaking, the discussions were sometimes held between small subgroups of people at a table (i.e., splitting into pairs).</p><p>As mentioned before, G1000 organizers used technology to make participation possible for citizens who had not been selected to attend the conference. Citizen groups from five to one hundred people gathered across Belgium to participate through G-Off, watching the expert testimonials live-streamed and then deliberated as well. Others took part through G-Home, a web-based discussion tool.</p><p>The ‘decisions taken’ at this stage were which ideas to support. After the deliberation and voting was finished, the following proposals proved most popular:</p><p>Unemployment:</p><ul><li>Make paid work more attractive by raising minimum wage (38%)</li><li>Limit the maximum duration of unemployment benefits (36%)</li><li>Individually differentiated support for jobseekers (35%)</li></ul><p>Pensions:</p><ul><li>Harmonize the system and make it more egalitarian (23%)</li></ul><p>Child support:</p><ul><li>Same amount of child support for each additional child (45%)</li></ul><p>Health care:</p><ul><li>Guarantee equality and equal access to the system (35%)</li><li>Reduce overconsumption by putting the general practitioner at the center (31%)</li><li>Higher taxes for the pharmaceutical industry (27%)</li><li>Smaller medicinal packaging and awareness campaign against overconsumption (21%)</li></ul><p>Division of wealth:</p><ul><li>Reform corporate taxation: lower, but abolish all loopholes (43%)</li><li>Tobintax: tax on financial transactions (31%)</li><li> Lower the costs of labor, especially for certain categories (27%)</li></ul><p>Immigration:</p><ul><li>Duty of integration (31%)</li><li>Faster procedures and objective criteria (26%)</li><li>Harmonize policy at the European level (25%)<br /> </li></ul><p><em>The third phase</em> of G1000 had as its purpose to elaborate the ideas generated through the Citizens’ Summit. A much smaller group of 32 citizens came together during three weekends to discuss, expand the proposals, and turn them into policy recommendations. The phase was organized using the citizens’ panel, or consensus conference method of deliberation, which is more intense than the broader approach of the previous two stages. The participants had greater support from the organization, but at the same time had full freedom in the choice of subjects taken up and their strategy for coming to more concrete recommendations and conclusions. They had for instance the option of inviting experts or stakeholders to their meetings. The group came together on the 14-16 September 2012, in the Flemish Parliament in Brussels; on 6-7 October 2012, in the Walloon Parliament  in Namur; on 9-11 November 2012, in the House of the Members of Parliament in Brussels.   </p><p>The participants discussed with each other and with invited experts or stakeholders. Of the three main themes of the Citizens’ Summit, they decided to focus on social security, specifically the topic labor and unemployment. This was divided the suggestion in six concrete challenges, for each of which they formulated a number of concrete recommendations:</p><ol><li>The divide between high and low wages</li><li>How can the factor labor cost be dealt with to increase employment opportunities?</li><li>Assisting labor market access   </li><li>Labor and our future generations</li><li>Work of quality for quality of life</li><li>Workplace discrimination</li></ol><h3><strong>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</strong></h3><p>The project aimed to add value in three different ways: through methodological experimentation with participatory politics; with concrete policy recommendations; and by putting the need for democratic innovation on the public agenda.</p><p>The organizers succeeded to carry out their entire plan, despite the fact that it seemed financially and organizationally unrealistic at the start. Immediate results were a lot of media attention, sustained for an extended amount of time, and in the end a clear and extensive final report with clear policy recommendation on a number of points concerning policies towards employment.</p><p>According to a posttest survey, “participants felt like they had sufficient opportunities to express their opinions and that they could participate without restraints.” Over 90% felt that other participants had been sincerely interested in their opinions, and 75% felt that they had been treated with great respect. More than 75% “felt that good decisions were made at the G1000.” These results suggest a high level of satisfaction in the quality of the deliberations.</p><p>The project has also resulted in many publications on the case, both by organizers as well as other researchers. Didier Caluwaerts, whose PhD was the basis of the methodology of the G1000, received the Jean Blondel PhD Award from the European Consortium for Political Research. The G1000 has been the subject of over twenty academic publications.</p><p>The project certainly succeeded in putting participatory politics on the public agenda. Politicians of every part of the political spectrum took note of and commented on the project. The organization was asked to give presentations on her project with deliberative democracy for many different types of institutions: from various levels of government, to civil society organizations, and universities. Furthermore, other people in Belgium took on the idea by organizing similar initiatives on a more local level or on a more specific topic (for instance a K35 in the city of Kortrijk, or a G100 on the future of education). These adopted names with a clear reference to the G1000, a testament to its groundbreaking influence. Since it has only been two years since the end of the G1000 though, it is still unclear whether this is the start of a tradition of deliberative democratic initiatives or a temporary hype. The project also garnered international attention, and a G500 has been organized in the Netherlands.  </p><p>Although the project and its resulting recommendations gained a lot of attention of politicians on all levels (including the PM) as well as from the media, it is unfortunately hard to measure to what extent they have had an effect on policies subsequently adopted.</p><h3><strong>Analysis and Criticism</strong></h3><p>The interesting choice to finance G1000 through crowd funding limited the project’s budget and required volunteers to spend lots of energy fundraising. Partnering with an academic institution might have helped this problem, although organizers may have felt this violated their principle of “independence.”</p><p>Bias was potentially introduced into the Citizens’ Summit deliberations because the expert positions probably did not reflect the full spectrum of expert opinions on each subject, and organizers had not provided further supplementary material such as background reading before the Summit. During the deliberations, facilitators attempted to combat bias by repeatedly telling participants that they were not required to follow the experts’ viewpoints.  According to the posttest survey, 23% said their opinions had been changed after hearing the experts and 50% of participants claimed to have been uninfluenced. Changing one’s opinion based on expert testimony is not, in itself, problematic; care needs to be taken, however, to ensure that the experts’ testimonies do not create bias towards certain solutions that other experts would disagree with.</p><p>The third face of the project has been criticized for its lack of transparency. Although it produced a much more concrete and unambiguous end product, some have suggested that it would have been better to finish after the Citizens’ Summit.</p><h3><strong>Sources and Links</strong></h3><p><strong>Organizations:</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.foundationfuturegenerations.org\">The Foundation for Future Generations</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.foundationfuturegenerations.org/fr/projet/g1000-le-sommet-des-citoyens\">Page on the G1000</a> [French]<br /><a href=\"http://www.foundationfuturegenerations.org/nl/project/g1000-de-top-van-de-burgers\">Page on the G1000</a> [Dutch]<br /><a href=\"http://www.g1000.org\">G1000 Website</a><br />G<a href=\"http://www.vormingplusantwerpen.be/icms/web/php/index.php?pag_id=220714\">-Off in Antwerp</a> [BROKEN LINK]</p><p><strong>Final report (PDF):</strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.g1000.org/documents/G1000_EN_Website.pdf\">English</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.g1000.org/documents/G1000_NL_Website.pdf\">Dutch</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.g1000.org/documents/G1000_FR_Website.pdf\">French</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.g1000.org/documents/G1000_DE_Website.pdf\">German</a></p><p><strong>News and Articles </strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.rethinkingbelgium.eu/rebel-initiative-files/events/seventh-public-event-g1000-european-citizens-initiative-malaise-democracy/G1000-Background-Paper.pdf\">Caluwaerts, Didier and Reuchamps, Min. “The G1000:  Facts, Figures, and Some Lessons from an Experience of Deliberative Democracy in Belgium.”</a> <br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQiLQLMFWKQ\">“It’s not the G20, it’s the G1000!”  Europe Weekly.

Nessa fase, ao lado do principal fórum foram adicionados dois novos sub-fóruns: um na igualdade de oportunidades, a fim de explorar as propostas sobre às igualdades e diferenças da população no agregado familiar e o discurso de como poderia ser desenvolvido o budgeting.O métodos de participação em que o Fórum foi criado, poderia discutir diversos aspectos e pontos críticos em torno da temática da participação cidadã no Orçamento Federal. </p><p>A terceira fase (06/05 - 05/09/2008), o sub-fóruns foram fechados. O fórum principal, ou seja, os participantes foram capazes de discutir, verificar e, finalmente, rever os documentos como também de reabordar as questões-chave e temas da discussão.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>Na discussão de cinco semanas no forum on-line o  registrou  1863 participantes, no total de 757 mensagens e 1291 casas, o computador através do orçamento previsto utilizou 914 justificativas das 14.095 apontadas no site. Com a ajuda  dos moderadores, os participantes decidiram optar por enviar 16 diferentes sugestões  para melhorar as finanças da cidade.</p><p>A plataforma de Internet registrou nesse período 6310 visitantes únicos e 213 992 exibições de páginas web individuais. Depois de completar a discussão on-line participação orçamento Freiburg os usuários foram registrados e classificados por categorias para obter valores em porcentagem referentes aos assuntos abordados dentro da plataforma on-line. Os 1.863 usuários registrados usaram esta oportunidade para avaliar o processo dentro de sua perspectiva.</p><p>O caso foi apresentado à Oficina eParticipation em Bruxelas organizada pelo projeto de estudo eParticipation. Em diversas ocasiões o processo participativo orçamentario de Freiburg foi discutido em outras conferências eDemocracy como  na conferência de orçamento participativo nacional da cidade de Manchester, em um congresso realizado em Leipzig ou em workshop sobre o orçamento participativo em Berlim. O caso também foi compartilhada com diferentes projectos europeu financiados pela Comissão, tais como o estudo eParticipation.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.freiburg.de/beteiligungshaushalt/archiv/2011/web/html/indexef6b.html?q=startseite\">\"Freiburger Beteiligungshaushalt\".

Nella giornata del Town Meeting  è stato elaborato un report dei lavori.</p><p>Il Town Meeting si è svolto il 6 febbraio  2010 in contemporanea in cinque sedi che costituiscono località importanti dal punto di vista del paesaggio toscano:</p><ul><li>Castelnuovo Berardenga;</li><li>Cortona;</li><li>Orbetello;</li><li>Piombino;</li><li>Prato.</li></ul><p>Essi si sono potuti esprimere su due argomenti principali:</p><ul><li>Quali sono i caratteri più importanti di un paesaggio, quelli da proteggere o, quando scomparsi o danneggiati, da ricostruire?</li><li>Che cosa occorre fare per preservare (o ricostruire) la qualità del paesaggio in Toscana?</li></ul><h3><strong>Participant Selection</strong></h3><p>I circa 150 cittadini coinvolti sono stati  estratti a sorte tra i residenti nei cinque siti geografici interessati in modo che potessero esprimere le loro opinioni su luoghi  a loro conosciuti. Ai partecipanti si chiede di contribuire con la propria creatività e capacità di ascolto alla buona riuscita dell’evento. L’obiettivo non è costruire proposte condivise da tutti i partecipanti ma di indagare le loro  percezioni del paesaggio e le diverse opinioni riguardo al problema della conservazione e trasformazione del paesaggio toscano.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>In Toscana quello del 6 febbraio 2010 (“Bello e possibile” il titolo scelto) è stato il settimo Town Meeting, in quattro anni, organizzato dalla Regione. E stavolta i lavori non si sono fermati alle discussioni ai tavoli, dove l'esito del confronto viene sintetizzato da un voto segreto, ma sono proseguiti con 'laboratori progettuali', dove cittadini e tecnici si sono riuniti attorno a grandi foto aeree dei cinque rispettivi territori per tracciare nuove linee per il futuro del  paesaggio.  </p><p>I toscani preferiscono recuperare e riusare, anziché sprecare altro territorio per nuove costruzioni. Almeno cosi la pensa la maggior parte dei 150 cittadini toscani che hanno partecipato al TM i cui risultati sono stati presentati durante gli Stati generali sul paesaggio che si sono svolti nell’auditorium di Santa Apollonia a Firenze. Gli stessi toscani vorrebbero parchi ed aree verdi, centri culturali (ma pochissime abitazioni) al posto delle fabbriche dismesse. Consigliano di ricostruire il paesaggio agricolo favorendo le piccole coltivazioni e le filiere corte, al posto delle monoculture, e salvaguardando  i caratteristici terrazzamenti. Propongono anche di costruire valorizzando le visuali, evitando le cattedrali nel deserto e uniformandosi alle architetture prevalenti, magari schermando le aree industriali con barriere di alberi o scegliendo i colori più appropriati al paesaggio. Sulla costa consigliano di evitare edifici troppo alti, ma per il promontorio di Piombino propongono architetture visibili da lontano. Chiedono anche delle piste ciclabili. Quasi uno su tre è disposto a rinunciare all’uso troppo frequente dell’automobile per salvaguardare il paesaggio, se fossero adeguati i trasporti pubblici. Per i toscani del TM la prima cosa su cui intervenire per risanare il paesaggio sono le abitazioni private e le aree urbane degradate, seguite dai borghi antichi collinari e montani: Alle istituzioni poi chiedono di identificare obiettivi chiari e di accompagnare gli interventi dei privati per garantire la qualità degli interventi (63%) più che prevedere dei vincoli rigidi (33%). Sono favorevoli a puntare a puntare per il futuro sul’”economia verde” tra cui pannelli solari eolico e geotermia, purché si individuano soluzioni che non danneggino l’ambiente e il paesaggio  (48%) e comunque solo dopo aver informato e coinvolto i cittadini (38%). Chiedono di partecipare soprattutto sulle grandi scelte e i grandi progetti ma ribadiscono anche le responsabilità del costruire bene e del controllo devono rimanere alla politica e agli architetti.</p><h3><strong>Analysis and Criticism</strong></h3><p>La critica principale riguardo a questo caso è sicuramente la mancanza di obbligatorietà delle decisioni per i governanti prese da  parte dei cittadini. Infatti i risultati, riportati dai report costituiscono sollamente delle linee di indirizzo generale per i governanti. E' quindi sotto l'aspetto dell'empowerment effettivo dei cittadini, cioè di quella quota di potere che essi dovrebbero avere, che il caso è debole. Infatti i cittadini, con l'aiuto dei tecnici, possono certamente fornire consigli ai governanti i quali però non sono in alcun modo obbligati ad accogliere le loro proposte.</p><h3>External

more than 30 hectares to the north of the historical city of Bologna, and was abandoned after its activities moved to the Food Center.   </p><p>The project’s primary objective was the growth of the neighborhood in terms of urban quality and services. The “regenerated” area in fact saw, beyond the realization of those goals, the creation of equipment for public use and vast green areas integrated with residential buildings, in a continuous system of open and fruitful spaces, in continuation with the urban environment of historic Bologna.</p><h3><strong>History</strong></h3><p>The urban participatory experiment for the revitalization of the ex-Market area of Bologna began in March 2005.</p><p>The total space considered in the experiment was 11,662 km of useful surface (including existing recovered spaces, such as the entrance to the ex-Market or the shelter), divided into:</p><ul><li>92,503 km residential (equivalent to around 1320 homes)</li><li>17,159 km other uses (tertiary-commercial)</li><li>16,700 km of public use (gym, school, clinic, social center, youth hostel)</li></ul><h3><strong>Participant Selection</strong></h3><p>Market Lab, a laboratory for urban participation, had been created by the end of the first phase of the participatory process. Market Lab unified the various activities and face-to-face encounters held to discuss the plan delineating the ex-Market area’s future.</p><p>Urban experts called “facilitators”, whose job was to learn the true needs of the citizens, were very important to the process  The participants in the project were the city administration, the Navile neighborhood, the local organizations, and interested citizens (men and women of various ages).</p><h3><strong>Deliberations and Decisions</strong></h3><p>The process was carried out in two lab phases. The first phase began in March 2005, with four meetings about the following considerations:  connections and relations between the neighborhood and the border; society and services; centrality and accessibility; green space and landscaping; environmental sustainability; technological innovation; and mobility. Conclusions included the construction of a new building for the Municipality of Bologna, homes, commercial buildings, public parks, a new clinic, a school, a gym, social and recreational centers, and a student center for the University.</p><p>The second phase began in September 2006 and ended in March 2007,  using participatory methods to imagine the implementation of important elements from the first phase, particularly the public park and green spaces, the social center Katia Bertasi, the shelter, and the new school.</p><p>Given that this phase was dedicated to deepening some of the previously-imagined aspects, it was necessary to widen participation and involve new subjects of diverse ages.  For this, it was thought best to have the lab move itself into the inhabited venues, into the headquarters of organizations and into the schools, using a work method for small groups.</p><p>Meetings between planners and interested groups of people were organized in various parts of the neighborhood.  This was also supplemented by work with children at schools through a series of other meetings, for example with the residents of the Katia Bertasi center (the elderly in the afternoon, the dance teachers and their students in the evenings, etc.) of the gym, the youth from Center XM 24, Caritas (local body of the Italian Episcopal Conference) and five parishes, organizations of business owners of Bolognina, other cultural and social organizations of the territory, a group of municipal employees, etc.</p><h3><strong>Outcomes and Effects</strong></h3><p>From the beginning of the discussions about mobility, connectedness was a central element of the Laboratory’s discussions. The collected suggestions included: a partial transformation of Via Grobetti into a green corridor/quick urban axis; the transformation of Via Fioravanti into a neighborhood road free of through-traffic; the identification of potential connection points between Villa Angeletti and the Park along the Navile; and the guarantee of continuity and bicycle access inside the area, and of connections with existing paths at the margins.</p><p>The first laboratory phase culminated in the drafting of the first plan and the following approval on the part of the City Council in July 2006, with the promise by the administration to make a second participatory laboratory phase.</p><p>The other priority which the participants felt strongly about was the theme of green space, and more generally public services and space.  In particular, participants felt that a park near historic Bolognina was a necessity.</p><p>The second phase concluded on June 23rd, 2007 with a street festival.  The new urban plant was presented beneath the old market shelter with the photo show “The Farmer’s Market of Yesterday and Today”, the video “The Market Lab”, and the projection “The New Plan for the Area of the Old Market.” Ethnic and organic markets, games with children, a treasure hunt, a vintage car show, theater, ball games, food, sport demonstrations, a tango with an Argentine orchestra, and many other events took place from the early evening into late in the night.</p><p>Although the project is still being realized today, these will be the greatest impacts on the zone and will culminate, immediately after summer 2012, with the burial of part of via Gobetti, an intervention which will require a mini revolution in viability.  And so the Market Consortium of Navile, the organization of property owners of the area’s buildable lots, decided to move forward to open up information on the project to the Bolognesi, especially the residents. They aim to provide punctual updates about the various interventions in the area in a transparent manner, including through an <em>ad hoc</em> website. The construction of the first homes will be ready between late 2012 and early 2013.</p><h3><strong>Analysis and Criticisms</strong></h3><p>The participatory process of the Farmer’s Market project involved the city administration, the Navile neighborhood, local organizations, and interested citizens of various ages including children, teenagers, the elderly, and teachers in the neighborhood.  The Laboratory project took 30 months in which there were 16 public discussions, more than 40 meetings between small groups and representatives in the neighborhood, and 15 meetings at schools with teachers and their classes.</p><p>When the first lab phase ended, the administration process reopened, and a new plan for the ex Market area, including the new public space suggestions from the second laboratory phase (park, shelter, community center, school, etc.), was approved by the City Council.</p><p>The ex-Farmer’s Market of Bologna project was an exemplary case of participatory processes.  An animated and complex process gave life to a projected based on the social and environmental quality of spaces within a strategic area of the city.</p><p>The experience of planning the Market was not limited to the elaboration of a simple urban project. It secondarily included more complex ideas about the development of the city and new models of settlement favoring the diffusion of a higher quality of life, from the care of public space, intended for the city’s civic and community life, to the capacity to encourage relations between people and therefore connections between existing spaces and those which will use them;  from promoting the mixing of future users and celebrating the diversity of spaces to the construction of an eco-neighborhood with a small energetic footprint;  to the definition of slow, light mobility grid which privileges pedestrian and cyclist space at the expense of the vehicular.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>External Links</strong></h3><p><a href=\"http://www.urbancenterbologna.it/index.php?/it/bologna-ex-mercato/ex-mercato-ortofrutticolo.html\">U</a><a href=\"http://www.urbancenterbologna.it/en/\">rban Center Bologna - Participatory Website</a> [ENGLISH]</p><p><a href=\"http://www.urbancenterbologna.it/index.php?/it/bologna-ex-mercato/ex-mercato-ortofrutticolo.html\">U</a><a href=\"http://www.urbancenterbologna.it/en/\">rban Center Bologna - Participatory Website</a> [ITALIAN]</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comune.bologna.it/laboratoriomercato/reports.htm\">Project Reports</a><a href=\"http://www.comune.bologna.it/laboratoriomercato/reports.htm%C2%A0%C2%A0\"> </a>[ITALIAN]</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comune.bologna.it/laboratoriomercato/download/cinque_temi-post_6.pdf\">Phase 1 Analysis</a> [ITALIAN]</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comune.bologna.it/laboratoriomercato/progetto.htm\">Images and Project Designs</a> [ITALIAN]<br /> </p><p><em>Note: this is an English translation of the original Italian case study, which can be found at <a href=\"http://participedia.net/cases/progetto-ex-mercato-ortofrutticolo-bologna-italy\">http://participedia.net/cases/progetto-ex-mercato-ortofrutticolo-bologna...</a></em></p>","average_annual_budget":null,"targeted_audience_JSON":"[\"Elected Public Official\", \"Appointed Public Servants (e.g. bureaucrats)\"]","title_en":"Project ex-Farmer's Market (Bologna, Italy)","purpose":"Consultation (i.e. to advise decision makers)||Community building (e.g. social capital)","facetoface_online_or_both_JSON":"[\"Face-to-Face\"]","geo_latitude":"44° 29' 39.084\" N","facilitator_type":"Professional Facilitators","specific_topics":"Municipal Urban Planning","lead_image":"{\"src\": \"220px-Bologna._Porta_Maggiore._Strada_Magiore._Torre_degli_Asinelli_IMG_3874_0.JPG\", \"title\": \"\"}","typical_sponsoring_entity_JSON":"[\"Local Government (e.g. Village, Town, City)\", \"Community Based Organization\", \"Individual\"]","type":"case"},{"facilitated":"No","file_attachments":null,"decision_methods_JSON":"[\"Voting\"]","purpose_other":null,"geo_country":"Germany","other_method_of_communication_with_audience":null,"geo_postal_code":"","geo_longitude":"9° 21' 0.4824\" E","facilitator_type_other":null,"number_of_volunteers":null,"method_of_communication_with_audience_JSON":"[\"Public Report\", \"Policy Recommendations\", \"Public Hearings/Meetings\", \"New Media (i.e. internet, texting, etc)\"]","updated_date":"2016-05-25T16:04:32","demographics_other":null,"methods":"733||4232||4313","geo_street":"","post_date":"2014-12-12T23:01:32","type_of_funding_entity_JSON":"[\"Regional Government (e.g. State, Provincial, Territorial)\", \"Individual\"]","video":null,"who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative_JSON":null,"number_of_part-time_staff":null,"method_of_recruitment_other":null,"staff_type":null,"ongoing":"No","issue":"Education &amp;

With this the students in southwest Germany recieve an organised way to participate in regional politics, especially in those concerning universities. The federal state started a co-governance project online at <a href=\"http://www.wir-wollen-deinen-kopf.de\">www.wir-wollen-deinen-kopf.de</a> from 24th of January till 3rd of March in 2012 and invited every citizen of Baden-Wuerttemberg, who is interested in the topic, to participate in different forms and to commentate the draft bill of the Ministery of Science, Research and the Arts.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>To give the students in Baden-Wuerttemberg a political voice in matters by which they are affected, the Ministery of Science, Research and the Arts wanted to reintroduce the \"Verfasste Studierendenschaft\". The Ministery decided to enter into a dialogue with the citiziens of Baden-Wuerttemberg. They wanted to integrate the citiziens and especially the students into the legislation process of this bill.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Until 1977 there existed a Verfasste Studierendenschaft in the universities of BaWü. From 1977 until 2012 there existed a representation of the students in university's senat called \"AStA\". But the AStA was not representive for the students, had no self-government of their constitution and no financial sovereignty. Their standing orders and their budget were decided by the university senat with a professorial majority. When the coalition of SPD and The Greens won the elections in 2011, they wanted to reintroduce the Verfasste Studierendenschaft to give the students at the universities a political voice. To assist their legislation process they started in January the 24th 2012 the participativeplatform <a href=\"http://www.wir-wollen-deinen-kopf.de\">www.wir-wollen-deinen-kopf.de</a>. In the first week 15.000 users visited the site and write 200 commentaries.</p><ul><li>7th February the draft bill is online free for comments.</li><li>15th February students discuss mostly the regulation of functions, role and finances of the Studierendenschaft and there is a anti-movement starting their own online-campaign against the bill.</li><li>29th February parallel to the online discussions there are students discussing with representatives of the universitys in the ministry about the draft bill. The first discussions already took place in Novembre and Decembre 2011.</li><li>On the 3rd of March the online discussion is closed. Over 48.000 users wrote about 508 contributions and provided 4.400 ratings.</li><li>April the 24th 2012 the federal state adopts the bill \"Gesetz zur Einführung einer Verfassten Studierendenschaft und zur Stärkung der akademischen Weiterbildung (Verfasste-Studierendenschafts-Gesetz - VerfStudG). It says that the discussions on wir-wollen-deinen-kopf.de had some influence on this bill and the Verfasste Studierendenschaft is reintroduced in BaWü.</li></ul><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>This project was initiated and funded by the federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. Formally responsible was Theresia Bauer, the Minister for Science, Research and the Arts in Baden-Wuerttemberg.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>Every user that was interested in the topic was free to participate in the forum. There was no need for a registration but there was the possibility to registrate. From 48 812 visitors 190 persons did register on the website. 130 people subscribed the newsletter. The data used for the registration gives the following distribution:</p><ul><li>Students: 60%</li><li>University Staff: 6%</li><li>Lecturers: 4%</li><li>Others: 6%</li><li>Not Specified: 26%</li></ul><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The supplied some information about the \"Verfasste Studierendenschaft\" and provided some initial theses about student participation. There were videostatements of the minister and of students that should give a brief introduction into the cases. The registered users could subscribe to the weekly newsletter and there was a big PR-campaign in BaWü. This PR-campaign included posters and placards at all universitys in BaWü, postcards in pubs and cultural institutions in the big university citys.There was several commercials in the canteen screens of the universitys and advertising banners on several websites.</p><p>Every user was able to rate and commentate every post and to send in their own thesis. The website worked like a discussion platform with a rating system for every post. The registered users could follow the discussions for example by subscribing to the weekly newsletter. And registered users had the privilege to participate in the votings.</p><p>This was the first time the federal state in BaWü accompanied a legislation with an online participation project. The public interest was big and from January till March 2012 there were 21 Newspaper articles on regional and nationwide newspapers.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>The results where collected by the ministry and summed up in a evaluation. The most discussed point was about forced contributions for the students and wasting of money. Within there was a disscussion about an article of the magazine ZEIT Campus. The article with the topic \"Die zehn größten Verschwendungen des Asta\" was about the money waste by this former student representatives the AStAs. The Verfasste Studierendenschaft should avoid such mistakes. The most positive rated discussion was about having different models for the organisation of the Studierendenschaften. Every university should discuss and decide on its own which model fits best for themself. The most negative rated post was against the Verfasste Studierendenschaft and against political discussions at universities.</p><p>The ministry collected a couple of outcomes here that influenced the legislation process and the final law. The users wanted the Verfasste Studierendenschaft to only participate in university politics and politics that have a linkage to these (for example politics about rents in cities which is an important interest for students). The Studierendenschaft should interrogate with the student services to avoid doubled structures. They should be a politically and religiously neutral with no attachment to a political party. And the students wish that they could discuss about the BAföG. There was a big discussion about a forced membership and financial contributions. The Landtag did finally decide to have no Opt-out right, because the Studierendenschaft needs the funding to manage their big range of tasks. The majority was against a quorum for decisions of the Studierendenschaft, so it wasn't implemented into the bill. Another big topic was the establishing of a united representation in the Land government. The users want to have five different representives for the five university forms. The last big point was about the finance. The students wish that the Studierendenschaft gets - aside the funds - money from the universities and the federal state. Finaly on the 24th of April in 2012 the Verfasste Studierendenschaft got introduced and refered to most of the online discussed points.</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>The project seems like a success. It was the first online based co-governance project of the federal state of Baden-Wuerttemberg and it ended up in a law. But you really have to criticize the population and the amount of participation. Since only registered users could vote in the votings some of the outcomes were about only 190 users. This is far away of beeing a representive population of students. They had a large PR-Campaign and as you can see 48.000 visitors were recognised. If you look at elections for university politics you mostly have a voter participation &lt;10%. In this case this doesn't seem to be the problem of online participation but more a general problem of participation in university politics. Beside the quantity aspect the discussions and the outcome of this project is of high quality. Under these conditions that might be a success for this project.*</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Baden-Württemberg, Ministerium für Wissenschaft Forschung Kunst. 2012. “Auswertung Der Online-Beteiligung Zur Wiedereinführung Der Verfassten Studierendenschaft in Baden-Württemberg.” <a href=\"http://mwk.baden-wuerttemberg.de/fileadmin/redaktion/m-mwk/intern/dateien/pdf/Verfasste_Studierendenschaft/Abschlussbericht_Online-Beteiligung_VerfassStud.pdf\">http://mwk.baden-wuerttemberg.de/fileadmin/redaktion/m-mwk/intern/dateie...</a></p><p>Landtag von Baden-Württemberg - Gesetz zur Einführung der Verfassten Studierendenschaft und zur Stärkung der akademischen Weiterbildung [VerfStuG]. <a href=\"http://mwk.baden-wuerttemberg.de/fileadmin/pdf/hochschulen/Verfasste-Studierendenschaft/VerfStudG_LT-Druchsache_15_1600.pdf\">http://mwk.baden-wuerttemberg.de/fileadmin/pdf/hochschulen/Verfasste-Stu...</a> [DEAD LINK]</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/md/zentral/einrichtungen/rektorat/kum/agsm/anhoerungsentwurf_gesetz_verfasste_studierendenschaft.pdf\">Draft Report by the Ministry for Science, Research and the Arts</a></p><p><a href=\"http://mwk.baden-wuerttemberg.de/fileadmin/redaktion/m-mwk/intern/dateien/pdf/Verfasste_Studierendenschaft/Abschlussbericht_Online-Beteiligung_VerfassStud.pdf\">Evaluation of Participatory Process</a></p><h3>Notes</h3><p>* The ministry points out in their final report that the population is not representative for the students in BaWü, but the quality of the outcomes is much more important.</p>","average_annual_budget":null,"targeted_audience_JSON":"[\"Elected Public Official\", \"Appointed Public Servants (e.g. bureaucrats)\"]","title_en":"Wir wollen deinen Kopf! - Reintroduction of the \"Verfasste Studierendenschaft\" in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany","purpose":"Consultation (i.e. to advise decision makers)||Co-governance (i.e. to share decision making with public authorities)","facetoface_online_or_both_JSON":"[\"Face-to-Face\", \"Online\"]","geo_latitude":"48° 39' 41.7744\" N","facilitator_type":null,"specific_topics":"Student Government","lead_image":"{}","typical_sponsoring_entity_JSON":"[\"Academic Institution\"]","type":"case"},{"facilitated":null,"file_attachments":null,"decision_methods_JSON":"[\"Voting\"]","purpose_other":null,"geo_country":"United States","other_method_of_communication_with_audience":null,"geo_postal_code":"","geo_longitude":"71° 3' 31.968\" W","facilitator_type_other":null,"number_of_volunteers":null,"method_of_communication_with_audience_JSON":"[\"Public Hearings/Meetings\"]","updated_date":"2016-07-29T17:54:05","demographics_other":null,"methods":"560||688","geo_street":"","post_date":"2015-01-04T22:00:17","type_of_funding_entity_JSON":"[\"Local Government (e.g. Village, Town, City)\"]","video":null,"who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative_JSON":null,"number_of_part-time_staff":null,"method_of_recruitment_other":null,"staff_type":null,"ongoing":"Yes","issue":"Children &amp; Youth||Budgeting||Community Development","who_paid_for_the_project_or_initiative_JSON":"[\"City of Boston\"]","tags":"participatory budgeting||youth","number_of_meeting_days":null,"other_interaction_among_participants":null,"number_of_full-time_staff":null,"path":"/cases/youth-lead-change-boston-s-youth-focused-participatory-budgeting-2014","language":"English","targeted_participants_other":null,"participant_selection_JSON":"[\"Open to all\", \"Open to all with targeted recruitment\"]","published":"Yes","other_organizing_entity":"City of Boston","targeted_participants_public_roles_JSON":"[\"Lay Public\"]","end_date_not_applicable":"","typical_implementing_entity_JSON":"[\"Local Government (e.g. Village, Town, City)\"]","other_images":"[]","content_language":"English","additional":"","geographical_scope":"Local (e.g. Neighbourhood, City/Town, Metropolitan Area)","content_country":"United States","not_applicable":"","start_date":"2014-01-01T00:00:00","geo_city":"Boston","end_date":"2014-06-01T23:59:00","geo_province":"Massachusetts","total_budget":null,"geo_phone":"","other_targeted_audience":null,"other_supporting_entities":null,"communication_mode_JSON":"[\"Discussion, Dialogue, or Deliberation\", \"Express opinions/preferences only\"]","if_voting":"Consensus","other_funding":null,"author_uid":8580,"no_monetary_budget":"","who_else_supported_the_initiative_JSON":null,"id":"4176","geo_name":"","completeness":"complete","decision_method_other":null,"targeted_participants_demographics_JSON":"[\"Youth\", \"Students\", \"Low-Income Earners\", \"Racial/Ethnic Group(s)\"]","total_number_of_participants":null,"body_en":"In 2014 the City of Boston initiated “Youth Lead the Change,” the nation’s first participatory budgeting (PB) process focused exclusively on youth (1). Its goals included civic education and engagement, and the inclusion of youth voices that are typically marginalized from politics in the City’s capital planning process. <h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>According to the original Request for Proposals (RFP) produced by the City of Boston, “the goals of Boston’s Participatory Budgeting project are to: Help ensure the capital plan reflects the priorities, interests and energy of Boston youth; teach youth about the City-building (and budgeting) process; empower youth to participate in government.”</p><p>The proposal submitted by the contractor, Participatory Budgeting Project (PBP), characterized the anticipated effects of the process as follows: “Giving Boston youth the ability to affect public spending will be an eye-opening experience with major impacts: (1) Education… (2) Community Building…(3) Empowerment… (4) Community Improvements…” The proposal later adds that PBP is “…particularly interested in engaging populations who are typically disenfranchised and marginalized from politics. This includes youth – especially low-income youth, youth of color and immigrant youth.” In a rulebook created by the steering committee for participatory budgeting in Boston, other goals cited were to \"increase youth power,\" \"allow all voices to be heard,\" \"build stronger, safer, and healthier communities,\" and \"strenghten city-wide sense of pride, solidarity, and equality.\"</p><h3>History</h3><p>The idea of bringing Participatory Budgeting to the City of Boston was initiated under Mayor Menino, and in keeping with a broader theme of Menino’s time in office, the administration sought to add a youth civic education component to the typical PB process. By the time the process began, Mayor Walsh was beginning his term in office, and his administration expressed continued support for youth programming and for YLC in particular. The first pilot happened from January to June 2014. </p><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>The City of Boston led and funded the project, which was implemented by the contractor Participatory Budgeting Project. A million dollars was written into the 2014 fiscal year capital budget for “Youth Lead the Change” with the actual spending to be determined through the YLC process. However, because the money was allocated within the capital budget, only capital projects would be eligible. This meant that projects to be proposed through the PB process must be for physical infrastructure or technology, be located on City-owned property, cost no less than $25,000 and last at least 5 years.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>While the program fell short of its initial goals for total turnout, it did a great job of targeting young people of color from low-income neighborhoods. In general, neighborhoods with high youth populations were well represented. Of those who participated this year, more than half said that they would participate again, and many would like to participate in more in-depth ways than they did this year.</p><p>Participants were mostly of high school age and voters were mostly from Boston Public Schools. However, among Change Agents, a majority attended exam schools, charter schools or suburban schools through the METCO program, and most seem to have been previously engaged through other Cityrelated programs and organizations, indicating a need to expand the deepest forms of participation to those least likely to have been reached by City services. In addition, young men were under-represented among participants relative to young women.</p><p>Attrition was a challenge, especially among youth members of the Steering Committee. In addition, young people who did come to the SC meetings didn’t always feel comfortable enough to share their ideas. However, they cite the success of certain facilitation techniques, such as small group discussions, in helping to mitigate this problem.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The process had several key stages: establishing a Steering Committee made up of thirty youth-serving organizations which created a rulebook for the process, holding idea assemblies in a variety of neighborhoods throughout Boston to generate ideas, engaging a core group of young people as Change Agents to turn those ideas into specific proposals, and holding a vote to determine which proposals would be funded through the 1 million dollar youth budget.</p><p>Change Agents made their decisions through deliberation and consensus, using a decision matrix which urged them to consider feasibility, impact and need. Voters, in contrast, were often hearing about the process for the first time when they arrived at the voting station, and there is some reason to believe that decision-making criteria of voters was more self-interested than that of Change Agents, raising some concerns around parochialism in the voting process.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>An initial set of 473 proposals generated by the idea assemblies was divided into six categories and committees of Change Agents were tasked with turning them into concrete proposals. They engaged in a dialogue with City officials who determined whether or not the ideas were capital eligible and provided cost estimates for individual proposals. Some participants felt inhibited by the size of the budget and the capital eligibility limitations. In cases where an idea was ineligible, City officials were sometimes able to suggest changes that would make it eligible or suggest alternate paths through which projects could be pursued outside of this process. Ultimately, Change Agents prepared a set of 14 proposals which were included on the ballot, and each voter could vote for up to four of these projects. The voting process resulted in funding for 7 projects, which included: Franklin Park Playground and Picnic Area Upgrade, Boston Art Walls, Chromebooks for 3 High Schools, a Skate Park Feasibility Study, Security Cameras for Dr. Loesch Family Park, Paris Street Playground Extreme Makeover Renovation, and New Sidewalks for New Parks.</p><p>In terms of the effects on participants, most of them cited social benefits, increased knowledge and skills, and feelings of empowerment. Social benefits involved the camaraderie within Change Agent committees and a sense of community across the program more broadly. Both Change Agents and youth members of the Steering Committee felt that they learned a lot through their participation in YLC, citing a broader awareness of needs in other neighborhoods and a better understanding of government processes and democracy in general. In addition, many participants reported gaining specific skills including leadership, teamwork, networking, communication and professionalism. Many participants also expressed feelings of power or reported a sense that their voices had truly been heard, while some reported quite the opposite – a sense of disillusionment or disappointment with the process, particularly when they worked on projects which were deemed ineligible or which failed to garner sufficient votes to win funding (while this appears to be a minority of participants, it may represent the viewpoint of others who dropped out of the process earlier).</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p>The limited timeframe resulted in challenges throughout the process, with participants feeling that they were unable to be as thorough as they would have liked. The <a href=\"http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/grillos/files/pb_boston_year_1_eval_0.pdf\">Pilot Year Evaluation report</a> (by Tara Grillos) makes the following recommendations:</p><ol><li>An expanded timeline is recommended, as well as better communication throughout all stages of the process, with respect to logistics, roles and responsibilities of various actors, and rules of the process. Related to the theme of information availability, it would also be desirable to enhance the educational aspects of the program, which were cited as major benefits of the process by interviewees.</li><li>To improve turnout and reduce attrition, participants recommend more direct youth involvement in outreach and marketing. In particular, improving the web presence of the program will be essential. For the more intensive forms of participation, specific efforts are required to engage more young men, more traditional public school students and more youth who are not already involved with City programming or related organizations. These efforts might involve street outreach (e.g., canvassing) and better coordination with the public school system.</li><li>Enhancing the social benefits (which proved so desirable for the Change Agents) within the Steering Committee could help to reduce attrition among the youth. In order to encourage participation by those youth who are already in attendance, the use of more participatory tools and activities during the SC meetings is also recommended. In general, Change Agents and SC Members should be made more aware of each other’s work to encourage a more holistic understanding of the process.</li><li>Careful consideration should be given to how to ensure a good fit between community priorities and budget outcomes and to reduce the risk of parochialism in voting strategies. Expanded educational efforts may help to address this, for example through an attempt to coordinate directly with civic education programs within public schools. Other options to consider include expanding the size of the budget, subdividing the budget by geographic or thematic categories, complementing the capital budget with programmatic funding (perhaps through external donor contributions), or using the process as a channel of input for the City of Boston’s capital planning more broadly.</li><li>Continued engagement for youth participants from this year still needs to be defined. Change Agents should continue to be involved in decision-making related to the implementation of the projects they proposed through this process to ensure that the final product reflects their vision. A de-briefing process should be established to report back to participants regarding the findings of this research and to allow for an honest discussion and exchange of ideas between different groups of participants regarding challenges faced this year and how to address them. Finally, now that there is a cohort of first-year youth participants who are already familiar with the process, YLC can draw on that resource to hire young people to serve in leadership roles in next year’s process. </li></ol><h3>External Links</h3><ul><li>\"<a href=\"http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/grillos/files/pb_boston_year_1_eval_0.pdf\">Pilot Year Evaluation report</a>\" (Tara Grillos)</li><li>\"<a href=\"http://www.challengestodemocracy.us/home/boston-launches-first-youth-driven-participatory-budgeting-in-the-us/#sthash.zuOEK6vt.dpuf\">Boston Launches First Youth-Driven Participatory Budgeting in the US</a>\" (Hollie Russon Gilman)</li><li>\"<a href=\"http://www.challengestodemocracy.us/home/youth-lead-the-change-boston-participatory-budgeting-goes-online-for-idea-collection-phase/#sthash.8wkqrST5.dpuf\">Youth Lead the Change: Boston Participatory Budgeting Goes Online for Idea Collection Phase</a>\" (Hollie Russon Gilman)</li><li>\"<a href=\"http://www.challengestodemocracy.us/home/participatory-budgeting-re-imagining-civic-engagement-in-the-city-of-boston/#sthash.Eb2xWDrG.y9OC5Zn7.dpuf\">Participatory Budgeting: Re-imagining Civic Engagement in the City of Boston</a>\" (recap of an event with HKS Professor Archon Fung and Chris Osgood and Shari Davis from the City of Boston)</li><li>\"<a href=\"http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/boston/\">Boston: The Participatory Budgeting Project</a>\" (A summary of the initiative from the contractor)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/YPB-Rulebook.pdf\">Youth Lead the Change Rulebook</a> (Steering committee for participatory budgeting in Boston)</li></ul><h3>Notes</h3><p>1) This article is an abridged version of the <a href=\"http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/grillos/files/pb_boston_year_1_eval_0.pdf\">Pilot Year Evaluation report</a> by Tara Grillos.</p>","average_annual_budget":null,"targeted_audience_JSON":"[\"Elected Public Official\", \"Organized Groups (e.g. NGOs, Business Associations)\"]","title_en":"Youth Lead the Change: Boston’s Youth-Focused Participatory Budgeting (2014)","purpose":"Co-governance (i.e. to share decision making with public authorities)||Collaborative delivery of services with public authorities||Community building (e.g. social capital)","facetoface_online_or_both_JSON":"[\"Face-to-Face\"]","geo_latitude":"42° 21' 36.2988\" N","facilitator_type":null,"specific_topics":"Municipal Participatory Budgeting||Youth Participatory Budgeting","lead_image":"{\"src\": \"Youth%20Lead%20the%20Change1.jpg\", \"title\": \"\"}","typical_sponsoring_entity_JSON":null,"type":"case"},{"facilitated":"Yes","file_attachments":null,"decision_methods_JSON":"[\"Getting sense of room/group (i.e. no formal voting)\"]","purpose_other":null,"geo_country":"Austria","other_method_of_communication_with_audience":null,"geo_postal_code":"","geo_longitude":"0° 0' 0\" E","facilitator_type_other":null,"number_of_volunteers":null,"method_of_communication_with_audience_JSON":"[\"Public Report\", \"Policy Recommendations\", \"Public Hearings/Meetings\"]","updated_date":"2016-02-23T12:26:57","demographics_other":null,"methods":"1692","geo_street":"","post_date":"2016-01-29T14:38:35","type_of_funding_entity_JSON":"[\"National Government\", \"Local Government (e.g. Village, Town, City)\"]","video":null,"who_was_primarily_responsible_for_organizing_the_initiative_JSON":null,"number_of_part-time_staff":null,"method_of_recruitment_other":"Experts were invited||50% gender quota on random selection","staff_type":null,"ongoing":"No","issue":"Community Development||Identity &amp;

The historic legacy is manifest in buildings of the concentration camps in Mauthausen and Gusen and an armament factory of the Nazi regime in St. Georgen. While some of these facilities already function as memorials, it has not yet been decided what to do with others: tear them down, use them for other purposes or also convert them into memorial facilities. The plan of the federal government to put some buildings under monumental protection stirred controversies in the population. Among citizens living in the region, a gap prevails between those, who want to forget and want to live a “normal” life and those who want to investigate and preserve the past. This problem also shows in a generational gap between the older generation closer to the past with some of their parents directly linked to the crimes of the Nazi regime and a new generation that feels more detached from – and sometimes more critical about – the past. Conflicts are also evident between locals and visitors. Memorial tourism often clashes with the need for privacy of locals. Tourists sometimes perceive locals to be directly associated with the horrendous crimes of the past. Sometimes pictures of locals are taken in private settings, rare incidents of hostility towards locals occur.</p><p>The purpose of the project \"Region of Consciousness\" was to develop new future prospects for the region, involving local citizens and local civil society. From the discussion of the problems described above, new projects for improving the lives of locals and the positive interaction with memorial tourists were to be developed.</p><p><strong>History</strong></p><p>To develop new perspectives for the region, a participatory process was designed by the project managers from the Institute for the Study of Conflicts. Two participatory instruments were employed: focus groups with experts, effected people and NGOs and so called citizens’ councils (originally <em>Wisdom Councils</em>), which are made up of twelve randomly selected local citizens who deliberate for one and a half days.</p><p>From January to March 2013 six focus groups were organized with experts from: 1) science, art and culture, 2) regional development, 3) economy, 4) emigrants from the region, 5) memorial initiatives and 6) an open focus group.</p><p>In February and March three citizens’ councils were organized, one in each village: Mauthausen, Gusen and St. Georgen.</p><p>In March a “Marked place of ideas” was organized, in which the ideas collected in the three citizens’ councils were presented, discussed, merged and further specified with an open public.</p><p>In April the steps of the project and the collected ideas were presented in a public event in front of a large audience.</p><p><strong>Originating Entities and Funding</strong></p><p> </p><p><em>Project leader:   </em></p><p>Alfred Zauner</p><p><em>Project execution:</em></p><p>Alfred Zauner</p><p>Brigitte Halbmayr</p><p>Paul Mahringer</p><p>Peter Menasse</p><p>Michael Patak</p><p><strong>Participant Selection</strong></p><p>For the focus groups experts were chosen and invited by the project managers.</p><p>For the citizens’ councils participants were randomly selected among the local population. A gender quota of 50% was aspired (in two of the three citizens’ councils six men and six women participated, while the remaining one consisted of five men and seven women). No other quotas were in place, however age and occupation appeared mixed in all councils.</p><p>The “Marked place of ideas” and the final presentation was open to the public.</p><p><strong>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</strong></p><p>In the citizens’ councils twelve participants deliberated the future prospects of the region. In this setting a special form of moderation was applied: <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/dynamic-facilitation\"><em>dynamic facilitation</em></a>, a method developed by Jim Rough (USA) in the early 2000s. He called the original version of citizens’ councils <em>Wisdom Councils</em>. The deliberative process is conceptualized as open, inclusive and dynamic conversation. In the beginning the moderator asks openly, “Considering future prospects of the region, what topic do you find most important, what does your gut tell you is most urgent?” After having collected several topics and decided, what is most important for the group to talk about, the moderator addresses one person at the time and listens. Whatever statement is made the moderator asks open questions in order to deepen the understanding of what has been said. Any idea or sentiment is given space. One person can be speaking for several minutes. The moderator documents everything that is said on four flip charts visible to everyone: Problems, solutions, concerns and facts. Then he or she turns to the next person who wants to speak. This creates an open and inclusive atmosphere. Although all participants hold a conversation with each other, they almost never directly talk to each other, but to the moderator. This way aggression can be ventilated, without directly attacking other participants. Moderators never censor what is said by participants. Even if it is off topic. Dynamic facilitation means going with the energy of the group. Whatever appears important enough to be said, is welcome. Everything is documented on the flip charts, without exception. As moderators are very curious and eager to listen, this attitude is reflected by other participants. Mostly participants are eager and happy to get a say, but also listen to each other carefully.</p><p>While in the first few hours mostly problems are addressed later solutions are discussed. Periodically, the moderator summarizes the discussion so they can be further developed in the following discussions. While most of the time who speaks, depends on who wants to speak and signals this to the moderator, occasionally the word is passed around the circle, so everybody gets to speak. In the end, participants draft a collective statement, in which they gather the ideas they have agreed on. As mentioned earlier, these statements were then presented to the public and discussed with other local citizens and politicians.</p><p><strong>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</strong></p><p>The project organizers wrote an extensive report summarizing the results from the focus groups and the citizens’ councils. The main topics were: Extending memorial; learning from regional history; future use of remaining buildings and spaces; encounter, dialogue and communication; confident region; networking and new structures.</p><p>The three regions founded an association to execute the ideas developed in the project. In the autumn of 2013 a three year plan was developed.</p><p><strong>Analysis, Criticism and Lessons Learned</strong></p><p>The participatory process described above has strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Its strengths lie in the dynamic integration of expert knowledge and citizens’ engagement. This way, the knowledge produced through academic specialization and social knowledge through every day experience of the ones directly effected are combined. This doesn’t only enhance the legitimacy of political decisions, but also their quality as multiple sources of knowledge are integrated. The great advantage of citizens’ councils in comparison with <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/deliberative-polling\">deliberative polls</a>, <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/consensus-conference\">consensus conferences</a> and many formats of citizens’ assemblies lies in the temporary separation of expert knowledge and every day knowledge in the first stage and their integration in the second stage. Other deliberative formats give priority to expert knowledge over citizens direct experience. While in deliberative polls, for example, citizens only deliberate with each other after having been exposed to expert inputs, in citizens’ councils experts never directly influence what participants think or deliberate about. Experts’ knowledge is integrated in the macro process of the project and has an effect on its results, but the ideas of citizen participants aren’t influenced or altered in citizens’ councils.</p><p>Citizens’ councils’ strengths lie in its integrative and inclusive effects. Participants feel free to utter grievances and concerns, while dynamic facilitation protects from direct attack. The atmosphere resulting from this method is creative, productive and inclusive. Minority opinions are heard and minority groups are treated with equal respect. The textually open procedure reveals citizens’ true concerns. In the case discussed here, this method enabled a civil and creative discussion every participant enjoyed although a potentially controversial and politically charged topic like the Nazi-past of the own region was discussed. Although many diverging and controversial opinions were uttered the overall civility and cordiality was maintained.</p><p>Criticism of the process described above can be uttered concerning the effectiveness of the decisions made and the lacking concreteness of the decisions in the first place. While some very specific projects were defined, others appeared more like blurry ideas or wishes. In the specific case described above, local office holders appear serious and eager to realize many projects developed in the participatory process. The actual effectiveness, however, strongly depends on the officials’ willingness to act as citizens’ councils’ outcomes aren’t binding but of merely advisory character.</p><p>Moreover, the selection process appears to have some weaknesses. First, why should only twelve participants, who are not elected by the populace, produce political decisions for the whole community? The lot as a tool appears arbitrary and produces a lack of legitimacy. This is especially the case when these twelve represent a large citizenry as citizens’ councils can be employed on state level as well. Here it would be advisable (and this is mostly the practice) that several citizens’ councils are held. This is also necessary since the deliberative process highly depends on group dynamic. As experience has shown, different citizens’ councils concerning the same issue held in the same time period, produce partly diverging (and partly overlapping) results.</p><p>Furthermore, the citizen’s councils discussed here proved biased as they showed a large effect of self selection. While invitations were sent out randomly, only around 10% of the invited followed the invitation. This self-selection bias means that usually more educated, verbally eloquent and politically active citizens participate, since there is no obligation to participate as in jury duty. This compromises representativeness.</p><p>Summarizing lessons learnt for the future:</p><ul><li>Separating participatory processes for expert knowledge and every day experience appears of high value. This way both sources of knowledge are treated equally and valuable insights from the every day perspective aren’t lost.</li><li>Citizens’ councils prove highly effective when it comes to inclusion and creativity.</li><li>The lacking legitimacy through participants’ selection by lot and the bias resulting from the specific group dynamics in each council can be countered by organizing several citizens’ councils concerning the same topic in proportion to the size of the population.</li><li>Legitimacy of citizen selection and representativeness could further be enhanced by introducing a participatory duty.</li></ul><p><strong>External Links</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.bewusstseinsregion.at\">http://www.bewusstseinsregion.at</a> (original page of the project, German

decisions on 100% of the spending in a local government in Western Australia.</p><h3>History</h3><p>A four year program of deliberative collaborative governance (‘2029 and Beyond’) at the local government of Greater Geraldton had witnessed several deliberative democratic initiatives including a deliberative poll, a citizens jury and an enquiry by design.  In the final years of the initiative, there was a significant community dissatisfaction at the City's attempts  to address cost shifting from the State Government, looming infrastructure backlogs and a revaluation of assets by significant rates and charges rises. A participatory budget (PB) on 100% of the municipal spend was seen as a way of addressing this community dissatisfaction and bringing community wisdom and legitimacy to this complex problem.</p><p>In  September  2013,  Council  formally  approved  the implementation  of  two  stratified,  random  sample  Participatory  Budgeting  (PB)  Community Panels.  The  1st,  the  10  Year  Capital  Works  PB,  had  the  task  of  deliberating  and recommending a priority list of capital works projects to be funded (around $70 million over<br />10 years), as well as a set of criteria (used to determine that ranking), that could be used by the  City  for  prioritising  future  priorities.  The  2nd  PB,  the  Range  and  Level  of  Services Community  Panel  (recommending the  allocation  of  100%  of  the  City  Region’s  operational budget of around $70 million annually) had the following task: recommending to the Council the  community  desired  range,  level,  and  priority  of  services  to  achieve  minimal  rate increases,  or  reductions,  within  the  budget  limitations  set  by  the  Council’s  adopted  Long<br />Term Financial Plan.</p><p>The Council committed the following regarding both Panels’ recommendations: The Council will:</p><ol><li>Seriously consider all recommendations made by the Community Panel;</li><li>Implement recommendations wherever feasible;</li><li>Where a recommendation or recommendations cannot be implemented, Council will clearly communicate the reasons to the Community Panel and the broader community; and</li><li>Where a recommendation or recommendations cannot be implemented, Council will seek to understand the intent of the recommendation/s and work with the Community Panel to find other ways to fulfil the intent.</li><li>Retain the power to veto any or all recommendations made by the Community Panel.</li></ol><h3>Originating Entities and Funding</h3><p>The PB's were sponsored and organised by the City of Greater Geraldton with design, facilitation  and implementation by Professor Janette Hartz-Karp, Dr Svetla Petrova, Dr Margaret Gollagher and Mr Rob Weymouth from Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute.</p><p>A “Independent Review Committee” (IRC) governance group was created  with the purpose of overseeing the operations of these two PB’s and certify their neutrality and transparency. It consisted of around 5 prominent community members and the Mayor as chair. The IRC was charged with verifying the representativeness of each Panel, the usefulness and adequacy of the information provided, and the time, information, and support that Panelists required. It also played the role of ombudsman for Panel members if issues arose. IRC members attended each Panel session, observed the facilitation and discussion, and then without staff and facilitators present, met with Panelists to review their day’s experience. Following this the IRC debriefed the project team to make improvements for the following week.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>To ensure representativeness of these two mini publics an independent local demographer was employed to create a random sample stratified by age, gender, indigenous and multi-cultural background, and residential location (as a proxy for socio-economic level). Twenty-five randomly selected participants participated throughout the 10 Year Capital Works PB Panel, and thirty-five participated throughout the Range and Level of Services PB, authorized to allocate 100% of the City Region’s operational budget.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The two panels sat consecutively on Saturdays from November 2013 to April 2014. On each deliberation day, an agenda was disseminated to participants, with the purpose and step by step process for the day. Often, ‘take-home’ work was given to participants between Saturday sessions, varying from talking to family and friends to get their views on a particular matter, to actually piloting some of the assessment instruments the group has developed. Panelists worked both in facilitated small groups as well as in plenary sessions.</p><p>The overall deliberation process adhered to the following basic steps –</p><ol><li>Understanding the PB’s ‘charge’, and understanding participatory budgeting, deliberative democracy, and quality deliberation;</li><li>Understanding the City’s overall budgeting process and those aspects most relevant to the PB’s charge, through briefing materials, short presentations, question and answer sessions, and continued availability of ‘experts’ when needed during small group deliberations;</li><li>Clarifying the Panel’s common values (together with those outlined in the Strategic Community Plan), and then determining the criteria or reasons to assess options;</li><li>Carrying out the assessment of options, calibrating findings between small groups;</li><li>Prioritizing options, if needed, including weighing the criteria/reasons for assessments;</li><li>Determining recommendations;</li><li>Writing their Final Report, and later formally presenting it to the City, the Council, and the media.</li></ol><p>To assist the Panel members in making decisions on behalf of the whole community and to draw greater numbers of collaborators into this process, attempts were made to reach out to the broader community. For the Capital Works PB, community and industry groups were able to put forward capital works proposals for assessment and prioritisation and for the Range and Level of Service PB, the Panel presented their draft recommendations for the range and level of services the wider community at a community forum and gathered public responses. In addition to these measures, social media (Twitter, Facebook) were used, before, during and after the deliberations for broader comment and disclosure. The partnership with the local newspaper was also utilised to publish numerous articles about the PBs before, during, and after their deliberations.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>In terms of effective problem resolution, Panel members rated the quality of the deliberation process very highly. Some of the final survey results were as follows:  97% said they understood the issues under discussion very well; 93% said they learnt about the issues and got new information very well or quite well; and 100% said they heard from people with differing viewpoints very well or quite well. This did not imply a lack of divergence of opinion, which is expected in wicked problems. Participant observation of small group discussions during the phases of clarifying common values and prioritising projects and services revealed strong levels of dissent, sometimes quite passionate and emotional. This apparent disconnect between the quantitative survey data and the participant observation was clarified through the qualitative interviews with participants. Several participants explained how they felt able to hear strongly held views and express their own, but then through the facilitated deliberation process, felt they had come to a conclusion that best suited all perspectives.</p><p>The Council endorsed the Report of the Capital Works Panel and instructed the CEO to implement the existing prioritisation, and utilise the Panel’s rating system for future assessment of infrastructure.  The Range and Level of Services report was also endorsed by Council and was used to form the budget for the 2014/2015 financial year. The final budget was passed by Council in an absolute majority, with Councillors speaking for the budget uniformly referring to the Panel report as being the basis for the budget, and hence their legitimacy for passing it.</p><p>All participants underwent significant shifts in attitude finding the City more trustworthy. Interviews with participants to further understand this shift indicated that their belief in City officials’ competency and benevolence (whether they act in the best interests of the community) had radically shifted.  Most interviewees in our PB study pointed to a greater understanding of the complexity and size of the problems that the City struggles with as being at the root of their change in attitude over the PB.</p><h3>Analysis and Lessons Learned</h3><p align=\"left\">This work has been based solidly on the principles of public deliberation which assume that everyday people have the willingness and capacity to resolve tough issues together. To do this, they need opportunities to participate in an environment that is inclusive of all viewpoints and representative of the demographics of the population, and is egalitarian, respectful and encouraging of considered discourse, where different viewpoints are explored, options are created and a coherent voice is encouraged to emerge. However, such considered discourse is only likely to eventuate if participants understand that their time and work together matters, in particular that their considered voice will be influential.</p><p>The missing essential link is the need for mutual respect and trust between those who govern and those governed. However, for this to occur, it will require those in power to make the first move – to entrust ordinary people to collaboratively problem solve and make decisions. This is only feasible if there are ongoing and numerous opportunities for public deliberation - meaningful participation - involving considered discourse, bolstered by iterative, two-way communication between ‘experts’ and lay people. It is the decision-makers who need to find new ways to share information, and to find the space for opportunities to share in decision-making, especially when there are wicked problems to address where there are no easy answers. The evidence has shown that the decisions made after such deliberation consistently aim to achieve the good of the community, rather than self interest. Such  decisions have greater public legitimacy, and hence are more easily implemented.</p><h3> </h3><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.cgg.wa.gov.au/your-council/having-your-say/-changescgg-community/community-panel-10-year-capital-works-plan.aspx\">10 Year Capital Works Plan Community Panel</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.cgg.wa.gov.au/your-council/having-your-say/-changescgg-community/community-panel-range-and-level-of-services.aspx\">Range and Level of Services Community Panel</a></p><p>Journal Article - <a href=\"http://epubs.scu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1325&amp;context=jesp\">Deliberative Collaborative Governance as a Democratic Reform to Resolve Wicked Problems and Improve Trust</a></p>","average_annual_budget":null,"targeted_audience_JSON":"[\"General Public\", \"Elected Public Official\"]","title_en":"City of Greater Geraldton Deliberative Participatory Budget","purpose":"Co-governance (i.e. to share decision making with public authorities)","facetoface_online_or_both_JSON":"[\"Face-to-Face\"]","geo_latitude":"0° 0' 0\" N","facilitator_type":"Professional Facilitators||Other","specific_topics":"Municipal Participatory Budgeting","lead_image":"{\"src\": \"maxresdefault.jpg\", \"title\": \"deliberation in action\"}","typical_sponsoring_entity_JSON":null,"type":"case"}]},{"type":"organization","hits":[{"geo_latitude":"0° 0' 0\" N","geo_longitude":"0° 0' 0\" E","language":"English","other_images":"[]","lead_image":"{}","published":"Yes","content_language":"English","path":"/organizations/regional-ministry-innovation-science-and-enterprise-andalusia","content_country":"United States","author_uid":"2161","lastmodified":1484364742820,"post_date":"2013-08-28T05:51:03","title_en":" Regional Ministry of Innovation, Science and Enterprise of Andalusia","id":"1267","updated_date":"2013-08-28T05:51:03","type":"organization"},{"geo_latitude":"0° 0' 0\" N","geo_longitude":"0° 0' 0\" E","language":"English","other_images":"[]","lead_image":"{}","published":"Yes","content_language":"English","path":"/organizations/consorzio-ctts","content_country":"United States","author_uid":"2161","lastmodified":1484364742820,"post_date":"2013-08-27T21:37:09","title_en":"Consorzio CTTS","id":"1262","updated_date":"2013-08-27T21:37:09","type":"organization"},{"body_en":"<p> <u><strong>Democratic participation and social innovation – the essence of the Institut du Nouveau Monde</strong></u><br /><br />The Institut du Nouveau Monde or INM (an equivalent English name would be New World Institute) is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit organization based in Montreal (Québec, Canada) whose mission is to promote citizen participation in the democratic life of Québec. Activities of the INM are rooted in the core concepts of social justice and inclusion, respect for democratic values and the principles of sustainable development, in a spirit of open-mindedness and innovation. In its activities, the INM adopts a structured, deliberative three-pronged approach to contemporary issues: making needed information available, fostering informed debate and bringing forward proposals for positions or action. <br /><br />The Institute was established in 2003 by a group of academics and figures from civil society brought together by Michel Venne, then (1990 to 2006) a journalist at the Montréal French-language newspaper, Le Devoir. The founders of the Institute believed that there was a crucial need for an institution that could effectively inform public debate and promote citizen participation on issues relating to the place, the role and the needs of a small nation like Québec in a globalized world.<br />The “New World” is first and foremost the Americas, the physical territory of which Québec is part. The expression also evokes the idea of renewal for our world, as exemplified by the spirit of explorers and discoverers. Another of the goals of the INM is precisely that: to explore and open up new horizons and celebrate successes, but also to look long and hard at the shortcomings, failures and needs of Québec society, relative to the rest of the world. The INM’s work is based on the firm conviction that the renewal of ideas entails citizen participation, because the introduction of new ideas cannot be the sole prerogative of experts or interest groups.<br /><br /><strong>1.    What does the INM do?</strong><br /><br />Activities of the INM centre around three key themes.<br /><br /><em>Key Theme 1: Development of Citizenship Skills</em><br /><br />The INM works to foster “citizenship attitudes” and contribute to the development of citizenship skills for individuals and organizations. It develops transferable expertise, conducts ongoing monitoring of citizen participation and organizes activities designed to educate, train and mobilize individual Quebeckers or support their involvement in community action, in particular through its annual Summer and Winter Schools for young people between the ages of 15 and 35. The Institute runs information campaigns and takes public stands on questions of participation and democracy. In addition, through its consultancy service (INM services-conseil), it also provides services to help organizations, businesses and institutions establish quality “participatory spaces”. The Institute’s organizational services are based on the best collaborative practice models known.<br /><br /><em>Key Theme 2: Promotion of ongoing debate on key issues for Québec society</em><br /><br />The INM advocates ongoing debate on key issues for Québec society. One illustration of this position is its creation of an open and easily accessible Agora or citizen think-tank. Quebeckers learn about participation by personally engaging in discussions on important public issues, knowing that the results of those discussions can potentially influence public policy or private initiatives. And the more they participate, the more they want to pursue their participation.<br /><br />The Agora has five basic components:<br />•    Ongoing observation of the evolution of Québec society and identification of issues that call for debate (in particular, through an advisory panel of publicly respected figures and publication annually of the almanac: L’état du Québec (meaning: The State of Québec – not available in translation), an annual overview of Québec society;<br />•    Information-gathering and, where relevant, production and dissemination of the information people need to participate in informed debate on current issues (preparation of theme-based kits on subjects such as health, the economy, culture, demography, mining development);  <br />•    Organization of deliberative democracy activities ranging from simple round-table discussions to structured exchanges over a period of several months, known as Strategic Rendez-Vous;<br />•    Dynamic facilitation of a web-based forum for discussion;<br />•    Active promotion of the ideas, projects and proposals arising from the discussions and debates it initiates, by communicating them to the general public and to policy-makers and by encouraging further reflection on outcomes (using instruments such as reports, reviews, publications, declarations…).  <br /><br /><em>Key Theme 3: Promotion of citizen participation, an essential component in the exercise and development of democratic rights</em><br /><br />The INM conducts a range of structured reflection and promotion activities on issues relating to democracy and citizen participation. It collects and makes available information on the current state of knowledge on democracy and citizen participation. It brings together diverse stakeholders for discussions on public participation, consultation mechanisms and the relationship between participatory and representative democracy. It engages in public debate on the way institutions are evolving and on the exercise of democratic rights, prepares advisory briefs and may, on occasion, take positions on questions of public policy, private sector initiatives, or current issues or events involving citizen participation, the way democratic institutions function, or the organization of participatory processes. The Institute also promotes citizen participation through its involvement in national or international issue tables or coalitions of relevance to its mission, and through its public presence and as part of a communications strategy that uses both traditional news media and social media to reach different target networks.<br /> <br /><strong>2.     INM Programs</strong><br /><br /><em>Key Theme 1:</em><br /><br /><em>Skills development for individual citizens and for organizations</em><br />Working with individual citizens<br /><br /><strong>Citizenship Schools: Summer and Winter Schools</strong><br />Since 2004, the INM has offered Summer Schools on Citizenship to young people between the ages of 15 and 35. Over a five-day period, they can hear presentations and participate in round table discussions, seminars and workshops, all designed to enhance their knowledge or understanding of the major issues of our times and help augment their citizenship skills.<br /><br />In a convivial and relaxed atmosphere, some five to seven hundred participants discuss current issues and define the kind of world they want to live in.<br /><br />In winter, Québec college students between the ages of 17 and 20 can attend the Winter School that the INM has now organized since 2007.<br /><br />Further information is available (in French only) at <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/programmes/ecole-dete\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/programmes/ecole-dete</a><br /><br /><strong>À go, on change le monde!  – Social Entrepreneurship</strong><br /><br />Since 2007, in association with the Caisse d’économie solidaire Desjardins, the INM has supported and promoted social entrepreneurship projects undertaken by young Quebeckers. Social entrepreneurs are people who propose practical and innovative solutions in response to social issues and who apply entrepreneurial principles in the creation and management of projects with pronounced social impacts, while ensuring community involvement in the process.<br /><br />The program, À go, on change le monde! offers young social entrepreneurs a range of different forms of support: access to information or advice, financial assistance, references to professional services, a mentoring network and a young social entrepreneurs’ club.<br />A further goal of the program is the development of increased public awareness of the role played by young social entrepreneurs in Québec.<br /><br />Further information is available (in French only) at: <a href=\"http://www.agoonchangelemonde.qc.ca/\">http://www.agoonchangelemonde.qc.ca/</a><br /> <br /><strong>Working with organizations: INM services-conseil</strong><br /><br />The Institut du Nouveau Monde provides four kinds of services to organizations: process support, facilitation of consultations or events, training workshops and lectures or presentations.<br /><br /><strong>Process support</strong><br />INM’s consultancy service can provide needed support to organizations looking for significant results around a variety of processes:  carrying out consultations involving citizen participation, establishing innovative internal working groups, organizing an event designed to provoke reflection and identify priorities, or wanting guidance around a forecasting and strategic planning process. INM services-conseil can play a facilitation role for a process already under way or help plan the different steps needed for a given project. <br /><br /><strong>Group facilitation</strong><br />Effective facilitation happens when the serious goal of having a group jointly come to meaningful conclusions is achieved through the use of a relaxed and fun-filled approach. INM services-conseil offers added-value service in that it can suggest the use of less familiar discussion methods which nonetheless produce tangible results: open forums, café conversations, 4-6 huddles, buzz sessions, the scenario technique, etc. In addition, the service works with a range of innovative and creative approaches such as social intervention theatre, street animation and video screenings to highlight particular issues, while also using more traditional facilitation methods, where appropriate. <br /><br /><strong>Training workshops</strong><br />Due to its expertise and use of participatory activities such as role-playing, experience-based approaches, round tables and situation simulation techniques, the INM has come to be recognized as a leader in its field. For questions on how best to communicate publicly, craft powerful messages or generate creative ideas, for looking more deeply into issues such as participatory local governance or any other issue relevant to the INM’s mission, the consultancy team can propose innovative approaches that will help participants better understand and retain the information they have been given.<br /><br /><strong> Lectures or presentations</strong><br />INM services-conseil has speakers available for lectures or presentations in a variety of different formats to explain the results of the Institute’s reflections and practices on the question of citizen participation. Alternatively, it can also draw on outside resources if a client organization would prefer to hear a range of points of view on a topic, give participants the opportunity to form their own potentially opposing opinions, and so spark debate on a subject.<br /><br />Further information on INM services-conseil is available (in French only) at: <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/services-conseil\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/services-conseil</a><br /><br /> <br /><em>Examples of projects undertaken for outside organizations</em><br /><br /><strong>Citizens’ jury</strong><br /><br />At the request of the Director General of Elections for Québec (DGEQ), the Institut du Nouveau Monde organized in January 2010 a citizens’ jury on the issue of the funding of political parties by private firms or other groups. Members of the jury first attended hearings where expert witnesses presented a range of background information on the topic, then deliberated together before submitting their advice to the DGEQ.<br />Further information is available (in French only) at: <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/jury-citoyen.html\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/jury-citoyen.html</a><br /><br /><br /><strong>Tout le monde à table</strong><br /><br />Staff and the travelling nutritionist from the Tout le monde à Table convoy travelled around the 17 regions in Québec to meet with a range of Québec families in different parts of the province. They wanted to get input from parents of children between 0 and 12 on issues around food and eating, such as the pleasures of eating well, eating together as a family and meal preparation. The information collected from the parents has been used by public health workers, elected policy-makers, the food industry and consumer groups to support the development of effective strategies for healthy eating.<br /><br />Further information is available (in French only) at: <a href=\"http://www.toutlemondeatable.org/\">http://www.toutlemondeatable.org/</a></p><p><strong>Agenda 21 for Culture</strong><br />The development of Québec’s Agenda 21 for Culture was the responsibility of the province’s then Ministère de la Culture, des Communications et de la Condition féminine . Québec’s Agenda 21 for Culture is a  21-point framework for action designed to spur a renewed vision of cultural development. Through its organization of corresponding public events and management of the project website, the Institute played a leadership role in the development of a comprehensive dialogue around the topic, as well as providing input for the final version of the document.<br />Further information is available at: <a href=\"http://www.agenda21c.gouv.qc.ca/\">http://www.agenda21c.gouv.qc.ca/</a><br /> <br /><strong>Province-wide citizen forums for the Bouchard-Taylor Commission</strong><br /><br />Two respected Québec intellectuals and specialists in cultural diversity, Doctors Gérard Bouchard and Charles Taylor, were appointed in 2008 to head this historic Commission.<br /><br />The two co-presidents commissioned the Institut du Nouveau Monde to organize four province-wide citizen consultation forums. Based on its expertise in organizing structured opportunities for productive citizen debate, the INM recommended the use of interactive events on different themes around cultural differences and the concept of “reasonable accommodation”, as a way to encourage all Quebeckers to voice their opinions on the key issues involved.<br /><br /><em>Key Theme 2: Promotion of ongoing public debate</em><br /><br /><em>Our publications</em><br /><br /><strong>L’état du Québec</strong><br /><br />The INM puts out an annual French-language flagship publication, L’état du Québec, a compilation reference aimed at a general (non-specialist) readership and providing a comprehensive portrait of Québec’s political, economic, cultural and social situation for the current year, together with the most recently available statistics.<br /><br />Further information (in French only) on this book, available in bookstores throughout Québec, can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.letatduquebec.qc.ca\">http://www.letatduquebec.qc.ca</a><br /><br />A number of supplements to this same publication are prepared for use in INM program activities.  The Institute also publishes a magazine on social entrepreneurship, À go! (in French only).</p><p><em>Dynamic organization of broad-based consultation and debate</em><br /><br /><strong>Strategic Rendez-Vous Forums</strong><br /><br />The purpose of the INM’s Strategic Rendez-Vous forums is to encourage open and informed debate between experts and members of the community, so as to map out a shared vision of the Québec we want and the kind of world we want to be in, twenty years from now.<br />The Institute uses a three-pronged approach: making needed information available, fostering informed debate and bringing forward proposals for positions or actions.<br /><br /> A steering committee of experts in the field proposes the questions to be debated and identifies relevant and easily understandable documentation. In each of the regions of Québec, community members are invited to take part in the debate on the issues identified. They meet again at the end of the process to finalize orientations and adopt proposals for concrete action. Outcomes from each of the Strategic Rendez-Vous forums take the form of recommendations communicated to the public and presented to both stakeholders and authorities in the community concerned. Strategic Rendez-Vous forums have so far been organized around topics ranging from the economy and health to culture and intergenerational issues.<br /><br />Further (French only) information on the two topics currently being debated (the first, social inequalities, and the second, democracy and citizen participation) can be found (in French only) at: <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/inegalites/presentation\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/inegalites/presentation</a> and at <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/democratie/presentation\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/democratie/presentation</a><br /><br /><strong>Public conversations on the future of mining in Québec</strong><br /><br />The Institute’s Public Conversations on the Future of Mining in Québec were held to objectively and impartially identify for the general public the main issues arising from the exploration and extraction of mineral resources in Québec, in addition to providing an open forum where citizens and community stakeholders could raise questions, express their concerns and, most importantly, explore potential solutions.<br /><br />In this way, the INM gives Québec citizens, organizations concerned about these issues and public policy-makers the opportunity to obtain information within an objective framework and engage in open-minded debate with others on the issue.<br />Further information (French only) is available at: <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/avenir-minier\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/avenir-minier</a><br /><br /> <br /><strong>The Future of Higher Education</strong></p><p>Québec witnessed unusually high levels of mobilization and unrest in Spring 2011. The provincial government subsequently acknowledged the need to re-establish a climate for dialogue by organizing a Summit on Higher Education.<br /><br />In keeping with the spirit of the pre-Summit process, the INM invited Québec citizens to join the collective reflection process. A total of four forums were held to allow Quebeckers of all ages and backgrounds to give their views about what higher education in Québec should be in the 21st century. A summary of the discussions in these forums was presented in a report to the Minister of Higher Education, in advance of the Summit.<br /><br />To the same end, a special Summit-focused Winter School was held for Quebeckers between the ages of 15 and 35.<br /><br />Further information (French only) is available at: <a href=\"http://www.inm.qc.ca/enseignement-superieur/presentation\">http://www.inm.qc.ca/enseignement-superieur/presentation</a><br /><br /><strong>3.    Participatory and collaborative approaches used by the INM</strong><br /><br />The following are some examples of the approaches used to support our different activities.<br /><br /><strong> Social Innovation Laboratory - LABIS</strong><br /> <br />LABIS is a process designed to encourage social innovation in response to complex social problems. It is organized in several stages and brings together stakeholders or citizens who embark on a collective reflection about issues to be addressed, using a deliberative approach that allows for complexity, creativity and diverging views of the future. The group first considers people’s different personal perceptions and realities, then jointly develops a comprehensive vision on which to base target strategies and innovative projects.<br /><br />Further information is available at:<br /><a href=\"http://inm.qc.ca/nos-activites/labis-laboratoire-dinnovation-sociale.html\">http://inm.qc.ca/nos-activites/labis-laboratoire-dinnovation-sociale.html</a><br /><br /><strong>Open Forum</strong><br />This approach allows participants in an event to design their own personal participation plans. Free of time constraints, and coming and going as they please, they develop personalized schedules, propose topics, and become involved in discussions of interest to them. The activity evolves in parallel with the rhythm of the resulting discussion circles, whose members are constantly changing. The goal of the experience is for participants to imagine innovative solutions to problems faced by their organizations, and allow them to see these problems differently as a result of the Open Forum approach.</p><p><br /><strong>Scenario Technique</strong><br />The Scenario Technique is a local deliberative forum that brings together representatives of a range of different groups (political decision makers, private-sector representatives, technical experts, resident citizens, etc.), all of whom have some degree of expertise in their respective communities. This mixed group is divided into teams which identify positive and negative scenarios for given future situations. Participants reflect on the difficulties encountered, draw up their own scenarios, then together design a local plan of action.<br /><br /><strong>4-6 Huddles</strong><br />A 4-6 Huddle is a perception and information sharing technique aimed at clarifying an issue in a context conducive to in-depth deliberation and debate. The method was developed as an ice-breaking activity for group events and takes the form of rounds of four to six huddles formed by four to six participants who change with every round.   <br /><br /><strong>Café Conversations</strong><br />Our Café Conversations provide opportunities for exchange, debate and dialogue among different people concerned or affected by particular issues. Working in groups of four to eight, people take part in rounds of discussion on one or several topics. The groups work simultaneously in the same room but participants change tables after each round, so as to spread ideas and extend discussion. The event ends with a plenary session, where the main ideas and conclusions developed in the discussions are presented to all participants.<br /><br /><strong>Citizen Caravans</strong><br />Citizen Caravans are a “street happening” technique used to stimulate reflection on current issues among people of all backgrounds and ages. Activities are playful, lively, and short-lasting. They are held in public spaces, such as streets, shopping centres or festivals, etc. where people can freely come and go. They are designed to appeal to children, teenagers and adults alike.<br /><br />The Caravans are results-based activities developed as an improved tool for taking the pulse of citizens on a range of topics. Street events are performed by actors equipped with portable suitcases stocked with a vast array of stimulating and amusing props developed by the INM.<br /><br /><strong>Buzz Sessions</strong><br />Each Buzz Session brings together small groups of people who, within a short period of time, must complete a task focusing on a particular problem. The tight deadline creates a sense of urgency that drives the group to propose ideas “in the rough” which, while not fully developed, nevertheless contribute to exploration of the subject under consideration.<br /><br /><strong>Panels or Citizens’ Juries</strong><br />A citizens’ jury is a group of twenty or so randomly selected people who can contribute to the political decision-making process. Participants are asked to examine and debate an important public policy issue. By the final stage of the process, the group is expected to be able to come to a collective decision on the subject.<br /><br />Citizens’ juries are often established when decision-makers feel trapped in the gridlock created by strongly divided public opinion and conflicting interests. To start with, needed background information is presented to the jury, which first debates the issue, then formulates recommendations that can be drawn on by policy-makers in the decisions they will later take.<br /><br /><strong>4.     Outcomes of the INM’s Work</strong><br /><br />The work carried out by the Institute has led to an increase in citizen participation in the democratic life of Québec. The organization is strongly committed to the broad dissemination of information on issues of importance for Québec, to advocating ongoing public debate on these issues and to promoting the ideas and projects resulting from that debate in the public arena and among decision-makers.<br /><br />By increasing citizen participation, the INM has helped transform the political culture of Québec, as well as legitimizing and showing the value of this kind of participation. At the same time, it is developing and applying new approaches, building up a wealth of transferable knowledge and creating models for dialogue and participation that can be drawn on to change the behaviours of opinion-leaders in Québec society and reform our democratic institutions. The INM has led Quebeckers to develop a taste for democratic activism. <br /><br />Some results of the INM’s work: in numbers and in public recognition<br />•    Through its various activities, the INM now reaches more than 20,000 people every year. Some 15,000 receive the Institute’s newsletter and 350 people are registered members of the organization.<br /><br />•    Since 2004, around 5,000 young people have participated in citizenship education activities in the context of the INM’s Summer and Winter Schools. Over a five-day period, they interact around presentations, round table discussions, seminars and workshops. The entire process is designed to help them increase their knowledge and understanding of the major issues of our time, while also learning civic skills. The INM’s Summer School was recognized in 2008 as a key component in Québec’s Youth Action Strategy, for a period of five years. Furthermore, in 2010, the Summer School received one of three prizes awarded by the Institute for Canadian Citizenship, for its outstanding civic education practices. Lastly, in 2011, the same Summer School was identified as one of the ten most innovative and promising projects among the 300 projects supported by the Montréal Island Youth Forum.<br /><br />•    Since 2007, as part of the program À go, on change le monde!, more than 900 young entrepreneurs have been able to receive information, advice, financial assistance and references to professional services, call on a network of mentors and join a young social entrepreneurs’ club.<br /><br />•    Since 2004, over 12,000 people have participated in citizen forums organized as part of the Strategic Rendez-Vous program.<br /><br />•    In 2007, the Executive Director of the Institute was appointed by the Government of Québec to the position of Vice Chair of the Working Group on the Québec Health System, an appointment stemming from the work carried out by the INM in 2005 on the reform of the Québec health system. The results of the Institute’s analyses and consultations were presented to the World Health Organization (WHO) which subsequently drew upon the INM’s expertise for work the WHO carried out in collaboration with the Ministries of Health of Portugal and Tunisia.</p><p>•    Since 2006, the INM has worked closely with ACFAS (Association francophone pour le savoir, a French-language multidisciplinary learned society), to support its organization of conferences for exchanges and the advancement of research on the theme of citizen participation. Over this period, more than 250 researchers and practitioners have met and discussed their work and approaches to it.<br /><br />•    In 2005, the INM was awarded the Claire Bonenfant Prize for Citizenship, an honour bestowed by the Government of Québec in recognition of the promotion of democratic values and citizenship education.<br /><br />Since the Institute’s creation in 2003, its influence has increasingly come to be recognized outside Québec as well as within the province. One example of this recognition was the fact that, in the three years between 2010 and 2012, the INM was responsible for organizing the World Assembly of Civicus, the Global Alliance for Citizen Participation, an annual forum attended by some 1,000 NGOs from all parts of the world.<br /><br />The Executive Director of the Institute is also a Fellow of the Carold Foundation for the advancement of citizenship in social change, at both the national and international levels, in addition to being a member of the Ashoka network of social entrepreneurs (a group that includes some 2,500 of the most outstanding social innovators in the world).<br /><br /> </p><p> </p><p> </p>","geo_street":"630, Sherbrooke W","geo_latitude":"45° 30' 19.1628\" N","geo_longitude":"73° 34' 22.8036\" W","language":"English","other_images":"[]","geo_province":"Quebec","lead_image":"{\"src\": \"Institut%20du%20Nouveau%20Monde.jpg\", \"title\": \"\"}","published":"Yes","content_language":"English||Français - French","tags":"public participation","path":"/organizations/institut-du-nouveau-monde","content_country":"Canada","author_uid":"7623","lastmodified":1484364742820,"post_date":"2013-08-19T19:36:10","geo_city":"Montréal","geo_country":"Canada","title_en":"Institut du Nouveau Monde","id":"1254","updated_date":"2014-01-27T19:14:13","type":"organization","geo_name":"Headquarter"},{"body_en":"<h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>To provide a comprensive resource on sociocracy as a method of governance and organization.</p><p>History</p><p>The website was begun by Sharon Villines, co author of <em>We the People: Consenting to a Deeper Democracy</em> in 2006.

The platform facilitates a two-way communication between the city and its citizens. Citizens post ideas, discuss them with each other and upvote the best ideas — in a fun and easy accessible way. On the other hand, the city uses CitizenLab to consult the opinion of its citizens via polling or to ask their creative solutions to an existing problem. Our SaaS solution helps cities to tap into the collective intelligence of the citizens and become more responsive to their citizens’ needs.<h6>About Our Product</h6>Our citizensourcing software is ready-to-use, yet fully customisable in an easy-to-use admin panel. The city can easily change the design of the platform, as well as pick its language out of already more than 20 available languages. The platform stands out by its user-friendly design, making it possible for every citizen to participate. We work with clean cards, different categories and an intuitive user interface on both desktop and mobile — submitting, commenting or upvoting is never more than two clicks away.<p> </p>Next to that, we make use of gamification in order to incentivise the citizens. Every time their posts or comments get upvoted, they will earn points (resulting in new badges) and will move up in the citizen leaderboard. The city gets quantified insights on which citizens are most engaged and can reward them for their valuable input with real-life benefits. Those citizens analytics are not only coming from our platform; we’re ready to integrate with any other product in order to give cities a one-stop portal to get insights on their citizens’ needs.<h6>Mission and Purpose</h6>CitizenLab aims at making tomorrow’s governments more citizen-centric, through their user-friendly cloud software, insightful data analytics and focus on mobile. Citizens do want to engage, but lack the means to do it in an easy accessible way. Today’s citizen participation possibilities in cities are limited to bureaucratic \"pen and paper\" forms, time-consuming in-person visits and town halls meetings, and a single vote every X years. Don’t get us wrong: they should stay in place, but existing technologies make it possible to create an interaction between city and citizens that is less time-consuming, is much cheaper and reaches a wider audience. It’s our ultimate goal at CitizenLab to make the most user-friendly cloud software for cities to get closer to their citizens. We take a data-driven approach in order to provide cities with the most insightful analytics on their citizens. CitizenLab wants to help cities to not only become reactive to their citizens’ needs, but also predictive. We’re sure that time is right for governments to adopt cloud software that helps them unlock the collective brainpower of their citizens, and that’s why we’re here.<h3>History</h3>CitizenLab got started in July 2015, by the founders Wietse Van Ransbeeck (22) and Aline Muylaert (22). <h3>Funding</h3><p>Incubated by the Belgian accelerator iMinds with 25k EUR in funding.</p><h3>External Links</h3><p><a href=\"http://citizenlab.co\">http://citizenlab.co</a></p><h3> </h3>","issue":"Budgeting||Planning (e.g. Urban planning, Transportation, etc.)","geo_latitude":"0° 0' 0\" N","geo_longitude":"0° 0' 0\" E","language":"English","other_images":"[]","lead_image":"{\"src\": \"logo_name_0.png\", \"title\": \"CitizenLab logo\"}","published":"Yes","content_language":"Português - Portuguese||English||Español - Spanish||Français - French||Italiano - Italian||Deutsch - German","tags":"platform||software||gamification||co-creation||civic engagement||civic tech","path":"/organizations/citizenlab","author_uid":"117485","lastmodified":1484364742822,"post_date":"2016-01-17T04:19:58","geo_city":"Brussels","geo_country":"Belgium","title_en":"CitizenLab","id":"4294","updated_date":"2016-01-17T04:19:58","sector":"For Profit","type":"organization"},{"body_en":"<p>Mission and Purpose</p><p>Our work to help build public knowledge about Congress is guided by the <a href=\"http://www.opengovdata.org/home/8principles\">8 Principles of Open Government Data</a>: public data should be open to the public, full stop.

The project is carried out at the Department of Political Science and Contemporary History at the University of Turku.</p><h3>Mission and Purpose</h3><p>Research question 1: How widely are democratic innovations used in Finland?<br />RQ 2: How democratic innovations affect and are perceived in policy processes?<br />RQ 3: Does the use of democratic innovations increase legitimacy of the decision-making?<br />RQ 4: What kinds of civil society actors and individuals have taken advantage of the new possibilities for participation at the national level?<br />RQ 5: How can the use of democratic innovations be modified to improve the quality of Finnish democracy?</p><p>By the end of year 2016 the research team led by prof. Maija Setälä hopes to provide a more comprehensive understanding of how democratic innovations can help improve the functioning of the representative democracy both from the perspective of decision-makers and citizens. This includes identifying what the main obstacles are for realizing the potential benefits promised by the democratic innovations and how these can best be achieved. These results are given out on several channels, including peer-reviewed articles, a final report, a closing seminar and popularized writings.</p><h3>History and background</h3><p>The interest in democratic innovations has increased also in Finland, although from a comparative perspective Finland has been a cautious user of democratic innovations. At the national level, advisory referendums have been constitutionally provided since 1987, and the institution of citizens’ initiative was adopted in 2012. This new instrument has raised a lot of interest and public debate in Finland. In a comparative perspective (Setälä &amp; Schiller 2012), the Finnish system of citizens’ initiatives has certain specific characteristics. First, the possibility for collecting signatures online on <a href=\"http://www.kansalaisaloite.fi\">www.kansalaisaloite.fi</a> is relatively unique in the world. It is also possible for non-state actors to organize the collection of signatures online. Second, the decision made in Spring 2012 to use open committee hearings in conjunction with citizens’ initiatives can potentially increase the overall transparency of parliamentary proceedings. In addition, deliberative mini-publics and crowdsourcing have also been tested at the national level.<br /><br />At the local level, the repertoire of democratic innovations is larger. Instruments of advisory municipal referendum, agenda initiatives and initiatives for an advisory referendum have been provided in the municipal law since 1990. Different forms of discursive participation, such as citizen juries, citizen committees, public hearings and online platforms are used in many municipalities. In a comparative perspective, democratic innovations are most widely used at the local level (Newton &amp; Geissel 2012). In the area of local public administration the interest in new forms of participation has increased especially because of municipal mergers and New Public Management. Traditionally strong local autonomy, however, makes Finland a special case together with other Nordic countries. There is not much legislation obliging municipalities to consult and engage citizens outside elections, and the Local government act only recommends how citizens could be engaged in the decision-making, resulting thus in great variance in the actual use of democratic innovations across municipalities. The local political context is therefore more crucial for political equality in Finland than in many other countries exploring forms of civic participation.<br /><br />Finland is, however, still predominantly a representative democracy in the sense that the formal decision-making power always remains within representative institutions. In this respect, it is uncertain whether the use of democratic innovations has changed the patterns of power-sharing in Finland.</p><h3>Specializations and activities</h3><p>Research questions are answered by analysing a set of different materials with both quantitative and qualitative methods. As part of the project new datasets will be gathered on subjects and use of the different forms of participation on national and local level.

Cook, a Cherokee from Oklahoma, UNITY evolved from a small group of passionate students who attended programming in southwestern Oklahoma to the national networking organization that hosts semi-annual conferences attended by youth councils from 35 states and Canada. J.R. Cook initially founded a dropout prevention, mentoring, and cultural retention organization, catering specifically to 10 public schools in Oklahoma. However, in 1976, due to the organization's success at building member's self-esteem, it was transformed from a regional to a national organization, gaining non-profit incorporated status. </p><p>At the UNITY conference in 1980 in Great Falls, Montana, the attendees pledged to refocus the organization to increase Native youth participation in government decision making and economic development. They published a \"Declaration for Independence\" in order to publicly take charge of their decisions and lives, which gained UNITY national recognition after Paul Harvey's commentary. </p><p>Today, UNITY is focused on facilitating a cross-tribal dialogue regarding community improvement, cultural retention, youth education, and healthy lifestyle campaigns on reservations.

The management of a workplace or an enterprise comes together with the selected delegates to negotiate and bargain on issues selected by the workers to be the agenda of the discussions.</p><p>A concept that was born in the middle of the rise of communism in early 20th century Russia, its original intent was to transform the labor relations to turn production into something collectively owned by the working class. In its current-day application, it has been implemented in different scales and in varying degrees in different countries. From small-scale applications such as in smaller businesses seeking to give voice to its employees to large-scale implementations such as the European Union’s crafting of the <a href=\"http://www.etuc.org/r/57\">European Works Council</a> (EWC) which, in part, serves to ensure that workers are assisted when they express desire for delegate-based representation, it has existed in different sizes. Beyond just scale, it has also served as a tool to open up different levels of participation to workers: from being just similar to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining\">collective bargaining</a> by encouraging mere negotiations with employers to truly turning over the power of the workplace to its employees by allowing the delegates to essentially be the management team. Ultimately and in each case, it functions to increase the participation of the workers in decision-making processes that affect their employment and general matters related to their trade.</p><p>Workers' councils are related to <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/university-student-government\">University Student Governments</a>.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>The creation of a workers’ council puts collective administration into the hands of the workers through their selection of temporary, revocable delegates who are answerable to the mass assembly who selected them. It seeks to reduce the separation between the majority of the workers and the decision-making processes within places of employment or enterprises by ensuring they have representatives. In some cases, the delegates are not merely negotiators but end up serving as the managing members.</p><p>Due to its socialist roots, it does endanger a more inclusive discussion among its participants as they are more likely to be polarized towards the more communist or socialist end of the spectrum. Similarly, its roots have impeded it from being received openly by less socialist societies that could potentially have been more open to increased participation from workers in workplace decision making processes.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Workers' councils first came into existence in Russia as part of the rise of communism in 1905. With the increasing focus on class struggles and giving power to the proletariat, the realization of such a world was devised in various ways. In the workplace, not only was ownership of the means of production thought to rightfully belong to the proletariat, so was the ability to decide all workplace and labor-related issues. The materialization of this within the workforce was in the form of workers' councils. It was thought that the selection of a mass assembly of temporary and revocable delegates would be the most efficient and minimally corrupt way of turning proletarian dictatorship into reality.</p><p>Outside of Russia, they rose into prominence during the German Revolution in 1918. As part of the captivation of power from the imperial government, workers and soldiers became unwilling to cooperate without a stake and a say in the new order. With the rise of Germany as a republic came the rise of workers' and soldiers' councils in Germany which gave a greater sense of involvement and participation to all through the use of delegates.</p><p>Over time, the decline of communism in Europe led to the reduction of the direct management of the workers of themselves. However, the ability of workers to participate was not necessarily forgotten or devalued. In fact, in September 1994, the European Works Council was established. It ensured the right of each worker to being consulted and being informed of company decisions at the EU level through their representatives. </p><p>As of yet, the only model most similar to the original conception of this participatory method that has been used in the United States came into being in the 1920s. The Workers' Council of the United States was a faction of the Socialist Party of America. However, it was short-lived due to problems within the political party. The applications of it in modern-day America are not much different from a typical labor union.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>There are two kinds of participants that could be broken down in discussing a workers’ council. The former is the general group that takes on this method. The latter is the selection of the delegates within the workers’ council that take on the primary role of communicator between the workers and the management or, in some cases, take on the role of management.</p><p>The method allowing worker governance of and by themselves is open to all who want to adapt it. However, there are systems in place that have allowed public policy to back the creation of these councils. Particularly, the European Works Council encourages the establishment of these by mandating them for larger companies operating at the European Union level (further discussed in the Influence, Outcomes, and Effects sub-heading) and obligating smaller companies to establish them should their workers express a desire for them.</p><p>As for the latter participation selection, this is often decided through an election. The delegates are selected by mass assemblies who nominate and vote on them. An important and quite consistent aspect of this selection of delegates involves the understanding that they are temporary, revocable and ultimately answerable to the assembly who chose them.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The deliberative and decision-making aspects of a workers’ council appear in three parts:</p><p>First, there is the selection of the delegates to represent the workers. There is no particular or uniform way that this has been conducted. However, as mentioned above, the most common way has been through elections among mass assemblies.</p><p>Second, there is the decision making process where the workers decide on their agenda. Often this is also conducted within a mass assembly. The workers play the role of the \"general public\" and vote on the issues they want to be discussed. Additionally, they vote on what their stances are on those chosen issues. Subsequently, they communicate these with the delegates who are then to relay this information to the management of the company and pursue these decided interests for them. </p><p>Lastly, there is the communication and negotiation between the delegates and the top management. In a more complete cycle of decision-making and information-sharing, not only do delegates share the concerns and viewpoints of the workers, those in positions of leadership or management with access to company information are ideally to divulge this information. By doing so, the delegates are expected to share this information with fellow employees to allow for a better informed agenda and decision-making.</p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>As workers’ councils emerged out of loosely defined ideas that merely intended to shift control of the means of production back to the proletariat, it has taken on different forms in different places throughout history.</p><p>The most profound and widespread rise of the use of this method has been in Europe among members of the <a href=\"http://europa.eu/\">European Union</a> (EU). With the establishment of the European Works Council, companies with at least 1,000 employees and with at least 150 employees in two different European Union member states are, under a directive, obligated to set up workers' councils to select delegates. These delegates then serve as the representative of the workers at the EU level. Not only are these representatives sent to communicate the demands and desires of the assembly who elected them, the participation of workers is ensured through the ECW's policy of transparency for the companies. This means that companies have an obligation to divulge company information to delegates to be shared with the workers.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Despite the seemingly good efforts of a workers’ council to promote the level of participation of workers in a workplace by bridging communication between them and the top management at a place of employment or enterprise, it has also attracted criticism because of its historical ties to socialism, communism and Leninism. Instead of being perceived as a democratic means to allow the participatory rule of the workers of themselves, it is seen as something that endangers a capitalistic enterprise. This has impeded its spread in some cultures that do not perceive those associations positively. More specifically, while European countries have been the most receptive to the formation of workers’ councils going so far as to mandate worker representation, the United States extends its having the lowest rates of union representation among developed nations to the relatively low levels of prevalence and knowledge of workers’ councils.</p><p>Additionally, even with those not critical of the Marxist, communist or Leninist roots of this method, it still has potential problems tied to the lack of uniformity on what is expected of it. The deliberative and decision-making aspects of it, if not very conscientiously planned, could just be another field through which politicking of dominant and powerful interests within the workplace could be reinforced.</p><p>Another problematic aspect is the unrealistic expectation that workers will have the leisure time to participate in mass assemblies. While the benefits of making time for such a gathering would probably outweigh the costs, in the labor industry where profit is important, there is a weak incentive for employers or the management of enterprises to want to encourage such councils.</p><p>Lastly, while its implementation in some instances does indeed lead to greater participation and inclusion of the diverse viewpoints of workers, it can also serve to create a mere illusion of that. More specifically there are instances when the delegates can choose even more selective delegates among themselves.

Essentially consensus means agreement. If consensus is part of a <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/deliberation\">deliberative process</a>, consensus seeking implies that all participants talk for as long as it takes for common understandings to emerge and finding a solution that everyone thinks is the best regarding not only his or her own but everybody's interests. Consensus thus emerges if the discussion is oriented towards the common good. Participants need to be open learn from each other, immerse in the perspective of others and be willing to regard the interests of others as important as the own interests. Often the word consensus is, however, used in non-deliberative discursive contexts where negotiations along self-interests is the mode of communication. Here consensus can simply mean compromise – a solution all parties can accept in the face of no other solution that would benefit them more. This notion of consensus is at the heart of so called \"consensus democracies\" – democratic states in which workers' unions and other employee representatives on the one side negotiate political compromise with employer representatives on the other side as part of the legislative process.</p><p>Consensus is rather an outcome and a goal than a specific democratic tool. However, consensus is of major concern in some democratic innovations like <a href=\"http://participedia.net/en/methods/consensus-conference\">consensus conferences</a>.</p><h3>Problems and Purpose</h3><p>Consensus seeking in the deliberative sense aims at overcoming the problem of majority rule in modern day democracies. Majority rule implies that the minority loses or is suppressed. Democratic theorists have called this phenomenon the \"tyranny of the majority\". If, in contrast, everybody agrees, then there is no minority to be dominated. This is why deliberative democratic theory suggests to not simply count votes which express the self-interest of each, but rather to talk to each other until interests transform and converge.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Consensus decision-making can be traced to the early forms of humanity. Hunters and gatherers made decisions within their tribes with the consent of all adult males, who gathered in a council, as Jane Mansbridge (1983) describes. Later more compitetive modes dominated the development of modern democracies with party competition and elections. Ideas of consensus were promoted by Anarchrist movements in Europe in the 1960s and 70s. Student occupations of universities and the autonomous movement occupying deserted buildings also practiced and still practice forms of consensus decision-making. These practical experiences of consensus seeking also inspired current discussions of deliberative democracy.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>While the advantages of consensus – to avoid a minority of \"losers\" and to promote reciprocal learning and understanding – are widely acknowledged, some disadvantages, however, also become apparant. So called \"difference democrats\" criticize consensus for potentially benefitting stronger participants in discussions. If there is no clear vote that measures every ones' self-interest and if everyone is supposed to decide regarding the interests of others (common good) than those who are less confident and less articulate might be at a disadvantage. Charismatic and loud-mouthed participants might dominate the conversation. As a result, the consensus everyone agrees on in the end might be biased in the interest of more verbal participants.</p><p>Many empirical studies show, that women, ethnic and sexual minorities and other groups in society who suffer from a history of domination and suppression tend to be less verbal in discursive settings. On average, they tend to speak less, ask more questions instead of giving statements and are more easily swayed by dominating participants. </p><p>Moreover, the orientation toward the common good tends to limit diversity of ideas, topics and interests. Consensus seeking implies homogenizing tendencies. These tendencies are amplified through an understanding implicit in epistemic deliberative democratic conceptions that there is an objective best solution to any given problem. Thus experts can more aptly find the best solutions with the help of science, which discovers objective truth. These implications of consensus lead into the direction of expert rule, which is, in the opinion of many, anything but democratic.</p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>\n\n\n</p><p>Mansbridge, J. (1983).

These applications are known as Wisdom Councils and Creative Insight Concils. Their purpose is to help community members gain a deeper appreciation of the complexity of the issue at hand, to engage in creative thinking about the issue, and to experience the greater sense of agency, meaning, and possibility that arise from authentic discourse. The outcomes of these \"microcosm councils\" are presented in a larger public meeting, to which community members, public officials, and government administrators are all invited.</p><h3>History</h3><p>Jim Rough originally developed Dynamic Facilitation to address challenging workplace issues with shop floor employees in paper mills and lumber mills in the Pacific Northwest. He then developed the Wisdom (microcosm) Council as a large-group application of this method, and used it successfully within several large organizations. Its first use in a public participation context was the Rogue Valley Wisdom Council, where a number of community members were chosen by lot and invited to participate in a facilitated day and a half, with the very open-ended topic of the general well-being of their larger community. At the conclusion of their extended conversation, the Wisdom Council presented their findings to a larger public gathering to which the whole community was invited. </p><p>This initial experiment resulted in a great deal of enthusiasm among both the participants of the Council as well as those who attended the public meeting afterwards. One of the attendees to the larger public gathering was Joseph McCormick, who was inspired by it to engage in further transpartisan work.  </p><p>Since that time, the format of \"Dynamic Facilitation + public microcosm\" has been used most extensively in the state of Vorarlberg in Austria, where the Office of Future-Related Issues has found this to be a highly effective approach for for public participation projects. They have conducted 20+ such projects in the six years between 2006 and 2013.</p><p>Outside of public participation projects, Dynamic Facilitation is also being used within organizational contexts in German-speaking countries, and the telecommunications company Swisscom has held a number of Wisdom Councils internally as an effective way to support the evolution of their organizational culture.</p><h3>Participant Selection</h3><p>There are three primary public-policy applications of Dynamic Facilitation: a) Community Wisdom Councils, where randomly-chosen participants engage in an open-ended exploration of what would be of benefit to the larger whole; b) Creative Insight Councils, where randomly-chosen participants explore a specific policy issue; and c) Dynamically-Facilitated stakeholder councils. Of these three approaches, only the first two use randomly-chosen participants.</p><h3>Deliberation, Decisions, and Public Interaction</h3><p>The participants in a dynamically-facilitated Choice-Creating Process engage in a creative exploration of an issue. Divergent and challenging perspectives are welcome, yet are redirected toward the facilitator, resulting in a climate where people feel safe to consider new perspectives. Some have called this a \"creative deliberation\", as the conversation generates a full and in-depth exploration of the issue at hand, yet in a non-linear manner.</p><p>The process evokes shared understandings and breakthroughs, rather than decisions among a fixed set of possibilities. A \"meeting of the minds\" (and hearts) is a typical outcome, although of course one cannot predict the particular area on which the group will arrive at their spontaneous convergence. </p><p>In the public policy applications, the microcosm group will explore the issue in a sequestered process, much like a jury (although with expert facilitation.) At the conclusion of their work, they share their findings at a large public gathering. Usually the gathering is run as a World Cafe, so that participants at the larger gathering will have the opportunity to respond in depth to the findings of the microcosm group. </p><h3>Influence, Outcomes, and Effects</h3><p>By design, Community Wisdom Councils and Creative Insight Councils are meant to influence the political process through their recommendations. Their findings do not have any formal authority. Nonetheless, they have some degree of moral authority based on their reflecting the thoughtful input of a random sample of the public at large, rather than the particular advocacy of an interest group.</p><p>In Austria, Switzerland, and Germany, where these processes have been used most extensively to date, the organizers generally obtain the agreement of the political and administrative sponsors, to respond explicitly to the recommendations in some way. Given the impossibility of foreseeing the outcomes of the process, the sponsors cannot guarantee that they will implement the reccomendations. However, they can commit to either implementing the suggestions or else offering a documented response as to why they decided to not do so. </p><p>At the public meeting, a volunteer task-force comprised is formed, comprised of members from various sectors, to meets monthly to monitor this implementation-and-response process. </p><p>To date, the effects have been largely favorable. Public officials and administrators have been positively impressed by the high quality of the input they receive, as well as by the microcosm participants' appreciation of the complexity of the issues involved, and their civic-minded enthusiasm. In turn, participants have repeatedly expressed a high degree of satisfaction with the experience, and often recommend that it be made more widely available.</p><p>In the State of Vorarlberg, where this approach has been used most widely, there has recently been a Constitutional Amendment on public participation. The implementation guidelines for this amendment provide for Wisdom Councils to take place on a yearly basis. In addition, for any public issue that gathers 1,500 signatures, the State will host a Creative Insight Council on that topic.</p><h3>Analysis and Criticism</h3><p>Vorarlberg's Office for Future-Related Issues (Büro für Zukunftsfragen) commisioned a qualitative research study to evaluate the outcomes of the \"BürgerInnenRäte\". The evaluation was conducted by the European Institute of Public Participation. </p><h3>Secondary Sources</h3><p>Dynamic Facilitation is mentioned in the following sources:</p><p>Atlee, Tom. The Tao of democracy: using co-intelligence to create a world that works for all.

The Right of Initiative was designed to this end.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Two public consultations have emerged from the Right of Initiative since it was implemented in 2010; one about the “state of urban agriculture in Montreal” and another about “the sharing of the existing bike path network”. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The petition</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The exercise of the right of initiative begins with the filing of a draft petition. This draft petition must clearly and briefly state the object of the proposed consultation, justify the desirability of the consultation and be signed by at least 25 people including three signatories designated to serve as representatives of the group.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Within 15 days of the draft petition being judged admissible by the concerned authorities, a notice is given to announce the beginning of a petition signing period. To obtain a public consultation, groups must obtain a required number of signatures within the following 90 days. A total of 15,000 signatures are required for proposals that concern a central city matter. (As of 2011, Montréal had a population of 1.65 million people.) In the case of a borough, 5% of the population, up to a maximum of 5,000 signatures, has to sign the petition. (Population varies from borough to another. More than 160,000 people live in Cote-des-Neiges--Notre-Dame-de-Grace, but only a little more than 20,000 in Outremont.) To give young people “an opportunity to become involved with municipal affairs”2, the city of Montreal allows every person aged 15 years and over to participate to the process.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The consultation</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Once the required number of signatures has been collected, a public consultation must be held within a reasonable delay. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the case of a public consultation bearing on a borough matter, the authority responsible for holding the consultation is the borough council, one of its committees, any committee or group of designated persons, as the council concerned may choose.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Where the city is concerned, the consultation is held by one of the council committee or by the Office de consultation publique de Montréal (OCPM), an independent public organization whose mission is to carry out public consultation mandates entrusted to it by the Ville de Montréal city council or executive committee.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The public consultation takes place in two parts. During the first part, representatives of the city or borough present information and answer questions from citizens. This is when those who have submitted the request will be required to explain the reasoning behind their request for a public consultation. In the second part, which takes place at least 15 days later, everyone gets the opportunity to express an opinion or submit a brief.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The outcome</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Those in charge of the consultation have to publish a written report within 90 days following the end of the proceedings. The document will itemize all concerns and opinions expressed at the hearing, analyze the proposals and draw conclusions or formulate recommendations, but will not render a decision. Then, the borough council or city council will inform citizens of the findings of the public consultation and, depending on the case, announce decisions that may be made and the reasons behind them. </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Limitations</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Montreal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities allows a maximum of three public consultations to be held per year by the city as part of the Right of Initiative, and two public consultations per year by each of the boroughs.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Furthermore, certain matters are ineligible and will not be considered for public consultation if they concern, for example:</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\">•       the sharing of powers, or the governance or the status of the city</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">•       administrative organization or contracts management</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">•       budget, fees or taxes</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">•       an urban development project for which a public consultation or approval by referendum has already been prescribed by law</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">•       a project that has already been submitted for public consultation within the previous three years</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle\">•       a call for tenders, pending or completed, or for which a contract has already been awarded</p><p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpLast\">•       a matter pending before the court or a matter that was the object of a judgment, or an out-of-court settlement.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Experiences</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Right of Initiative was used successfully by the Montrealers in 2011, when 29,000 people signed a petition requesting a public consultation on the state of urban agriculture. (Urban agriculture can be defined as “the growing of plants and the raising of animals for food and other uses within and around cities and towns”7. Its proponents wanted to enlighten this growing phenomenon and to obtain public support, in order to make Montreal a more green and sustainable city.)</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The petition campaign was led by dozens of organizations and volunteers through the city for 90 days. The outcome was considered as a great success, as the proponents collected almost double the amount of required signatures. It forced then Montréal Mayor Gérald Tremblay to announce the holding of a public consultation under the auspices of the Office de consultation publique de Montréal in the spring of 2012.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">More than one hundred briefs and opinions were presented to the OCPM during the hearings, which were attended by some 1500 people. The process was longer and more comprehensive than what is prescribed by the law. Members of the commission attended meetings with representatives of several organizations in a “preconsultation” period. A scientific conference and a public exhibition on urban agriculture were organized. Six information sessions were then held across the city, before the citizens were invited to submit and present their briefs during seven audition sessions. People were able to participate on the commission website.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">That led to the release of a report detailing the state of urban agriculture in Montréal and identifying the main obstacles to its development in October 2012. The document also included a list of 20 recommendations to the city.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Then, in March 2013, the Montréal executive committee announced the creation of a 20-member permanent working group on urban agriculture, to ensure the hearings would produce some concrete results.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">At the present time, only one other public consultation has emerged from the Right of Initiative. In September 2011, a group of citizens has submitted to the city a draft petition that was deemed eligible. The subject of the request was: \"Forbid electric scooters on Montreal bike paths\". Soon thereafter the city and the group representative agreed that a public consultation by a standing committee of city council on the types of vehicles that could be allowed or prohibited on the Montreal bike path network was sufficient. A series of 15 recommendations were eventually made to the city council in spring 2012.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Samuel Tremblay, Université de Montréal</p><p class=\"MsoFootnoteText\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">This paper is part of a research project funded by the SSHRC, calls ‘Expertise, organizational field and the diffusion of public participation practices’ (2012-2016) and directed by Laurence Bherer (Université de Montréal), Mario Gauthier (Université du Québec en Outaouais) and Louis Simard (Université d’Ottawa).</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">Sources :</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">[1] Ville de Montréal (2012), By-law 05-056-1: By-law concerning the Montréal Charter of Rights and Responsibilities and the Right of Initiative, Online. <a href=\"http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/DROIT_INITIATIVE_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/BY-LAW_05-056-1_RIGHT_OF_INITIATIVE_IN_PUBLIC_CONSULTATIONS.PDF\">http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/DROIT_INITIATIVE_FR/MED...</a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">[2] Ville de Montréal (2011), Take the initiative...it’s your right!, Online. <a href=\"http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/CHARTE_MTL_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/RIGHT_OF_INITIATIVE_BROCHURE_31-01-11_FINAL.PDF\">http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/CHARTE_MTL_FR/MEDIA/DOC...</a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">[3] Ville de Montréal (2011), Leaflet – Right of Initiative to public consultations, Online. <a href=\"http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/DROIT_INITIATIVE_FR/MEDIA/DOCUMENTS/LEAFLET%20-%20RIGHT%20OF%20INITIATIVE%20TO%20PUBLIC%20CONSULTATIONS.PDF\">http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/DROIT_INITIATIVE_FR/MED...</a></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">[4] Ville de Montréal – Cabinet du maire et du comité exécutif (2013), « Montréal met sur pied un Comité de travail de la collectivité sur l'agriculture urbaine », CNW Telbec</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">[5] Ville de Montréal, Official city portal – Ville de Montréal, Online. <a href=\"http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5798,85041649&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL\">http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5798,85041649&amp;_dad=porta...</a> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">[6] Office de consultation publique de Montréal (2012), « L'agriculture urbaine à Montréal : des initiatives multiples qui nécessitent une meilleure coordination, estime l'OCPM », CNW Telbec</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p><p>[7] Office de consultation publique de Montréal (2012), État de l’agriculture urbaine à Montréal : Rapport de consultation publique, Online. <a href=\"http://ocpm.qc.ca/sites/ocpm.qc.ca/files/rapport_au.pdf\">http://ocpm.qc.ca/sites/ocpm.qc.ca/files/rapport_au.pdf</a></p>","communication_mode":"Discussion, Dialogue, or Deliberation","stages_other":null,"minimum_duration":null,"tags":null,"typical_sponsoring_entity":"Community Based Organization||Individual","best_for":"Achieving Public Goods","title_en":"The Right of Initiative to public consultations ","decision_methods":null,"minimum_cost":null,"path":"/methods/right-initiative-public-consultations","description":null,"post_date":"2013-12-03T01:59:57","stages":null,"methods_of_interaction":null,"language":"English","typical_funding_source":"Local Government (e.g. Village, Town, City)","other_images":"[]","published":"Yes","video":null,"lead_image":null,"maximum_duration":null,"type":"method"}]}]}
