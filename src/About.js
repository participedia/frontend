        <div className="text">Participedia is a research partnership representing institutions and organizations around the world. The team produced Participedia.net as a tool to connect their research and bolster it with publicly crowdsourced knowledge about democratic innovations. All members of the Participedia community are integral to this process. <br /><br />The initial vision for Participedia was developed by Archon Fung (Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University) and Mark E. Warren (Department of Political Science, University of British Columbia), and is guided by a set of standing committees.</div>
